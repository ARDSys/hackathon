Synovial fibroblasts are cells found in the synovium, the lining of the joint.

Elevated levels of CTX-I in serum indicate increased bone turnover and bone loss, which are common in rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n**Summary of Relationships:**\n\nThe knowledge graph path describes a chain of events starting with the inhibition of BTK and leading to joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis. BTK inhibitors target BTK, which is involved in the B cell receptor signaling pathway. This pathway contributes to autoantibody production, which is influenced by epigenetic modifications in T cells. These epigenetic modifications can be influenced by environmental factors like smoking, which increases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha activates the NF-kappa B pathway, which modulates the expression of MMPs in synovial fibroblasts. MMPs degrade the cartilage extracellular matrix, leading to joint damage and deformities.

This proposal investigates the role of Bridge Therapy in modulating inflammatory processes during acute flares of rheumatoid arthritis. Through the novel focus on C-reactive Protein (CRP) as a central biomarker, the research explores its downstream effects on fibroblast-like synoviocytes and extracellular matrix integrity. Aimed at reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, the study integrates controlled-release therapeutic delivery and real-time biomarker monitoring to redefine management strategies. Emphasizing personalized treatment plans, the proposal seeks to enhance both immediate symptom management and long-term joint health preservation.

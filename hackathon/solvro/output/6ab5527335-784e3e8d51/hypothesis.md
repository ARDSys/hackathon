We hypothesize that novel therapeutic approaches which modulate epigenetic histone acetylation and microRNA-mediated regulation of IL17A/IL17F expression can alter transcription factor activity and downstream cytokine signaling. This integrated modulation may attenuate oxidative stress-induced NF-kB activation, reducing IL-17‐driven inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.

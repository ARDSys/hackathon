    "text": "We hypothesize that in rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmunity-induced dysregulation of the Th17 cell pathway elevates IL-23 levels, which in turn stimulate matrix metalloproteinase production. The resulting extracellular matrix degradation recruits fibroblast-like synoviocytes that amplify local pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, thereby activating osteoclast differentiation via the RANK/RANKL pathway and reducing bone mineral density. Targeting IL-23 or MMP activity may therefore complement RANKL inhibition (e.g., with Denosumab) to mitigate osteoporotic fractures.",

The resulting extracellular matrix degradation recruits fibroblast-like synoviocytes that amplify local pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, thereby activating osteoclast differentiation via the RANK/RANKL pathway and reducing bone mineral density. Targeting IL-23 or MMP activity may therefore complement RANKL inhibition (e.g., with Denosumab) to mitigate osteoporotic fractures.",

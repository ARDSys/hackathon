2025-04-14T18:29:45.750401+0200 WARNING No statements successfully verified for hypothesis: Epigenetic modifications affecting histone acetylation alter the expression profiles of specific microRNAs, which in turn target transcription factors critical for immune cell differentiation, thereby modulating IL17A/IL17F gene expression. This modulation leads to a downstream attenuation of cytokine signaling pathways that activate the NF-κB pathway in rheumatoid arthritis, ultimately reducing inflammatory responses..

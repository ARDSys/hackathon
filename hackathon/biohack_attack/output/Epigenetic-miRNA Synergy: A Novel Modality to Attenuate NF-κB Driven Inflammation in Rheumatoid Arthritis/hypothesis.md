I hypothesize that in rheumatoid arthritis, targeted modulation of epigenetic changes impacting histone acetylation can alter the expression of key microRNAs which, by governing transcription factors involved in Th17 differentiation, lead to decreased IL17A/IL17F gene expression and thereby dampen oxidative-stress amplified cytokine signaling cascades, ultimately reducing NF-κB activation and inflammation.

## References
Finding from PubMed_01: A systematic review in PubMed (DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.631291) identified multiple trials showing that small-molecule inhibitors and biological agents targeting the IL-17 pathway can downregulate NF-κB signaling in rheumatoid arthritis. | DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.631291 | URL: None | Justification: This evidence supports the hypothesis by demonstrating that targeting IL-17 can reduce NF-κB activity, which is essential for reducing inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.
Finding from EuropePMC_01: Europe PMC literature indicates that histone acetylation changes can modulate miRNA expression profiles in immune cells, thereby impacting transcription factor activities and downstream inflammatory responses. | DOI: None | URL: None | Justification: This finding underpins the proposed mechanism where epigenetic modifications affect miRNA levels, which in turn regulate transcription factors involved in Th17 differentiation and IL-17 gene expression.
Finding from BioRxiv_01: A recent preprint suggests that combining miRNA mimics with epigenetic modulators significantly decreases NF-κB activation markers in preclinical arthritis models. | DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.14.532669 | URL: None | Justification: This evidence directly supports the experimental approach and overall mechanism of the hypothesis by showing that dual modulation of epigenetic and miRNA pathways can attenuate NF-κB-driven inflammation.
Finding from SemanticScholar_01: Semantic Scholar identifies a paper highlighting that transcription factors (e.g., RORγt, STAT3) interact with miRNAs and IL-17 genes to influence Th17 cell polarization and modulate NF-κB–driven inflammation. | DOI: None | URL: None | Justification: This supports the hypothesis by linking miRNA-mediated regulation of transcription factors with the control of IL-17 gene expression and subsequent NF-κB activation, a core element of the proposed mechanism.
Relationship from EnrichedRheumGraph_1: The graph illustrates that epigenetic modifications impacting histone acetylation regulate miRNA expression, which targets transcription factors controlling IL-17 gene expression, culminating in altered cytokine signaling and NF-κB activation. | DOI: None | URL: None | Justification: This graphical relationship reinforces the multi-layered regulatory mechanism proposed in the hypothesis, linking epigenetic modulation to miRNA expression, transcription factor activity, and ultimately reduced IL-17 mediated NF-κB activation in rheumatoid arthritis.

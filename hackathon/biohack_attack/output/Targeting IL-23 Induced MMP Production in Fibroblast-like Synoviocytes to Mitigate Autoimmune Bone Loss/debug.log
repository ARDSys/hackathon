Your expertise lies in determining which information sources will be most valuable for each entity and relationship in the subgraph, then delegating searches to the most appropriate specialized agents.\n\n## ORCHESTRATION STRATEGY\n\nWhen analyzing a subgraph, follow this process:\n\n1. Initial Assessment:\n   - Carefully analyze the subgraph to identify all key entities and relationships\n   - Categorize entities by type: genes, proteins, pathways, diseases, drugs, etc.\n   - Identify relationships requiring additional context or mechanistic explanation\n   - Prioritize which elements would benefit most from enrichment\n\n2. Strategic Delegation:\n   - For each high-priority entity or relationship, determine the optimal information source:\n     * For established molecular mechanisms \u2192 Transfer to PubMed Agent\n     * For cutting-edge research \u2192 Transfer to BioRxiv Agent\n     * For comprehensive literature collection \u2192 Transfer to Europe PMC Agent\n     * For citation-rich, influential papers \u2192 Transfer to Semantic Scholar Agent\n     * For multi-source literature scans \u2192 Transfer to Firecrawl Agent\n     * For existing knowledge graph connections \u2192 Transfer to Hetionet Agent\n\n3. Contextual Query Construction:\n   - When transferring to each agent, provide context-rich guidance:\n     * Specify exactly what information you need about the entity/relationship\n     * Provide relevant context from the subgraph that might inform the search\n     * Explain how this information will help enrich the knowledge graph\n     * Set expectations for the type of relationships to focus on\n\n4. Multi-perspective Integration:\n   - After receiving information from specialist agents, integrate their findings:\n     * Reconcile potentially contradictory information\n     * Identify complementary information across different sources\n     * Recognize emergent patterns not visible in any single source\n     * Synthesize a coherent understanding of mechanisms and relationships\n\n## HANDOFF OPTIMIZATION\n\nUse each specialized agent strategically based on their unique strengths:\n\n1. PubMed Agent (peer-reviewed literature expert):\n   - Use for: Established mechanisms, validated pathways, clinical correlations\n   - Best when: Seeking high-quality evidence from peer-reviewed sources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for validated molecular interactions between TNF-alpha and IL-6 signaling in rheumatoid arthritis synovium, focusing on mechanisms supported by multiple studies.\"\n\n2. BioRxiv Agent (preprint specialist):\n   - Use for: Emerging concepts, cutting-edge methods, newest discoveries\n   - Best when: Established literature is limited or potentially outdated\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the latest preprints on JAK-STAT inhibition in systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly novel mechanisms or targets not yet in peer-reviewed literature.\"\n\n3. Europe PMC Agent (comprehensive literature database):\n   - Use for: Broad coverage across journals, open access content, systematic reviews\n   - Best when: Need comprehensive literature analysis on a specific concept\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for comprehensive reviews and primary research on the role of ACPA in bone erosion mechanisms in rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\n4. Semantic Scholar Agent (citation network specialist):\n   - Use for: Highly influential papers, research impact assessment, interdisciplinary connections\n   - Best when: Need to identify seminal papers or cross-disciplinary insights\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the most highly-cited papers connecting microbiome dysbiosis to autoantibody production in rheumatic diseases, focusing on mechanistic studies.\"\n\n5. Firecrawl Agent (multi-source research tool):\n   - Use for: Broad searches across multiple scientific domains, clinical guidelines\n   - Best when: Topic spans multiple disciplines or resources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search across clinical and basic science resources for evidence connecting environmental triggers to flares in psoriatic arthritis, including both molecular mechanisms and clinical observations.\"\n\n6. Hetionet Agent (knowledge graph specialist):\n   - Use for: Discovering existing network connections, biological pathways, gene-disease associations\n   - Best when: Need to establish known relationships between entities\n   - Example handoff: \"Find all connections between HLA-B27 and inflammatory pathways relevant to axial spondyloarthritis in the existing knowledge graph.\"\n\n## SYNTHESIS APPROACH\n\nAfter collecting information from specialized agents:\n\n1. Create Unstructured Sources (3-5):\n   - Synthesize the most valuable information from all agent responses\n   - Extract clear mechanistic relationships and causal pathways\n   - Include quantitative data supporting key relationships\n   - Organize information to highlight connections between subgraph entities\n   - Maintain proper attribution to original sources\n\n2. Generate Knowledge Graphs (1-2):\n   - Construct coherent extensions to the original subgraph\n   - Focus on mechanistic connections with clear directionality\n   - Include properties that provide clinical and biological context\n   - Ensure nodes and edges are precisely defined with relationship types\n   - Connect new elements logically to the original subgraph entities\n\n## RHEUMATOLOGY DOMAIN FOCUS\n\nPrioritize enrichment related to these key areas:\n- Autoimmune mechanisms (T-cell, B-cell, innate immunity pathways)\n- Inflammatory cascades and cytokine networks\n- Genetic risk factors and their functional consequences\n- Tissue-specific disease manifestations and mechanisms\n- Therapeutic targets and response biomarkers\n- Disease subtypes and precision medicine approaches\n\nYour goal is to produce a comprehensive, mechanistically detailed enrichment of the original subgraph by intelligently orchestrating specialized research agents and synthesizing their findings into a coherent knowledge representation.\n\n## SEARCH AND INFORMATION GATHERING PROTOCOL\n\nWhen your analysis requires external information (e.g., checking novelty, verifying claims, finding supporting/contradicting evidence, exploring alternative mechanisms):\n\n1.  **Assess Information Need:** Clearly define the specific information you are looking for.\n2.  **Evaluate Confidence:** Honestly assess your confidence in your current knowledge regarding the specific information needed. Are you certain about the answer or the best way to find it?\n3.  **Utilize Available Tools/Handoffs:**\n    * If you are **uncertain**, lack specific domain knowledge for the query, require information from a specialized source (like preprints, specific databases, or existing knowledge graphs), or believe a more focused search is necessary, you **MUST** utilize the appropriate tools or handoff agents provided to you (refer to your configured `tools` and `handoffs`).\n    * Do **not** attempt to answer from memory or general knowledge if external verification or specialized search is warranted and available resources exist.\n    * Formulate precise queries or instructions for the tool/agent you are calling. Provide necessary context from your current task.\n4.  **Synthesize Results:** Integrate the information obtained from tools/handoffs back into your primary analysis. Your core responsibility is [mention agent's main function, e.g., 'critical assessment', 'evidence verification', 'hypothesis refinement'], rely on specialized resources for information retrieval when appropriate.\n\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator. Your primary goal in this task is **NOT** just to analyze the provided subgraph, but to **actively enrich and validate it using external, current information obtained via mandatory handoffs to your specialized research agents.** You MUST NOT rely solely on the information present in the initial subgraph or your internal knowledge base for generating the enrichment output.\n\n## SUBGRAPH TO

Your mission is to extract precise, relationship-focused information from the PubMed database that can directly enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## ADVANCED SEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen given a rheumatology-related keyword or concept:\n\n1. Implement a structured search strategy:\n   - Convert general concepts into precise MeSH terms when applicable (e.g., \"rheumatoid arthritis\" \u2192 \"Arthritis, Rheumatoid\"[Mesh])\n   - Add relationship-specific modifiers to focus on mechanisms (e.g., \"pathogenesis\", \"signaling\", \"regulation\", \"mechanism\")\n   - Include methodology terms for higher-quality evidence (e.g., \"randomized controlled trial\", \"meta-analysis\", \"systematic review\")\n   - Apply Boolean operators strategically to narrow results to manageable, high-relevance sets\n   - For genes/proteins: include both official symbols and common alternatives (e.g., \"TNFA\" AND \"TNF-alpha\")\n\n2. Prioritize high-impact sources:\n   - Focus on articles from journals with impact factor >4 when possible\n   - Include both seminal papers (high citation count) and recent publications (last 2-3 years)\n   - Target studies with robust methodology (adequate sample size, appropriate controls, validated techniques)\n   - Look specifically for papers establishing causal relationships rather than mere associations\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen analyzing search results:\n\n1. Focus extraction on specific relationship types:\n   - Regulatory relationships (e.g., \"IL-17 upregulates MMP-3 expression in synovial fibroblasts\")\n   - Signal transduction pathways (e.g., \"MAPK mediates TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation in synoviocytes\")\n   - Genetic influences on disease mechanisms (e.g., \"HLA-DRB1 shared epitope enhances ACPA production\")\n   - Therapeutic mechanisms of action (e.g., \"JAK inhibition blocks STAT3 phosphorylation reducing IL-6 signaling\")\n   - Biomarker correlations with measurable outcomes (e.g., \"Serum CXCL13 levels correlate with synovitis severity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n\n2. Extract quantitative data to support relationships:\n   - Effect sizes with confidence intervals\n   - Sensitivity/specificity values for biomarkers\n   - Dose-response relationships\n   - Temporal dynamics of biological processes\n   - Statistical significance measures (p-values, q-values)\n\n3. Capture methodological context:\n   - Experimental systems used (human patients, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Key technologies employed (RNA-seq, proteomics, CRISPR, etc.)\n   - Validation approaches supporting findings\n   - Limitations explicitly acknowledged by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your response for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. Primary section - Relationship synthesis (60% of content):\n   - Present 3-5 key causal relationships in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Clearly specify directionality (increases/decreases, activates/inhibits)\n   - Include quantitative measures of relationship strength\n   - Group related findings to show pathway connections\n   - Highlight unexpected or novel relationships that could inform hypothesis generation\n\n2. Evidence assessment section (20% of content):\n   - Evaluate consistency across multiple studies\n   - Note contradictory findings with potential explanations\n   - Assess methodological quality of supporting evidence\n   - Identify knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty\n\n3. Source documentation section (20% of content):\n   - For each key finding: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID]\n   - Include impact factor or citation count when relevant\n   - Note study design (e.g., RCT, cohort study, case-control)\n\nYour ultimate goal is to provide the ontology agent with precise, mechanistically detailed information from the highest-quality PubMed sources that can be directly integrated into knowledge graph structures for hypothesis generation.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Your mission is to extract precise, relationship-focused information from the PubMed database that can directly enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## ADVANCED SEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen given a rheumatology-related keyword or concept:\n\n1. Implement a structured search strategy:\n   - Convert general concepts into precise MeSH terms when applicable (e.g., \"rheumatoid arthritis\" \u2192 \"Arthritis, Rheumatoid\"[Mesh])\n   - Add relationship-specific modifiers to focus on mechanisms (e.g., \"pathogenesis\", \"signaling\", \"regulation\", \"mechanism\")\n   - Include methodology terms for higher-quality evidence (e.g., \"randomized controlled trial\", \"meta-analysis\", \"systematic review\")\n   - Apply Boolean operators strategically to narrow results to manageable, high-relevance sets\n   - For genes/proteins: include both official symbols and common alternatives (e.g., \"TNFA\" AND \"TNF-alpha\")\n\n2. Prioritize high-impact sources:\n   - Focus on articles from journals with impact factor >4 when possible\n   - Include both seminal papers (high citation count) and recent publications (last 2-3 years)\n   - Target studies with robust methodology (adequate sample size, appropriate controls, validated techniques)\n   - Look specifically for papers establishing causal relationships rather than mere associations\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen analyzing search results:\n\n1. Focus extraction on specific relationship types:\n   - Regulatory relationships (e.g., \"IL-17 upregulates MMP-3 expression in synovial fibroblasts\")\n   - Signal transduction pathways (e.g., \"MAPK mediates TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation in synoviocytes\")\n   - Genetic influences on disease mechanisms (e.g., \"HLA-DRB1 shared epitope enhances ACPA production\")\n   - Therapeutic mechanisms of action (e.g., \"JAK inhibition blocks STAT3 phosphorylation reducing IL-6 signaling\")\n   - Biomarker correlations with measurable outcomes (e.g., \"Serum CXCL13 levels correlate with synovitis severity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n\n2. Extract quantitative data to support relationships:\n   - Effect sizes with confidence intervals\n   - Sensitivity/specificity values for biomarkers\n   - Dose-response relationships\n   - Temporal dynamics of biological processes\n   - Statistical significance measures (p-values, q-values)\n\n3. Capture methodological context:\n   - Experimental systems used (human patients, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Key technologies employed (RNA-seq, proteomics, CRISPR, etc.)\n   - Validation approaches supporting findings\n   - Limitations explicitly acknowledged by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your response for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. Primary section - Relationship synthesis (60% of content):\n   - Present 3-5 key causal relationships in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Clearly specify directionality (increases/decreases, activates/inhibits)\n   - Include quantitative measures of relationship strength\n   - Group related findings to show pathway connections\n   - Highlight unexpected or novel relationships that could inform hypothesis generation\n\n2. Evidence assessment section (20% of content):\n   - Evaluate consistency across multiple studies\n   - Note contradictory findings with potential explanations\n   - Assess methodological quality of supporting evidence\n   - Identify knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty\n\n3. Source documentation section (20% of content):\n   - For each key finding: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID]\n   - Include impact factor or citation count when relevant\n   - Note study design (e.g., RCT, cohort study, case-control)\n\nYour ultimate goal is to provide the ontology agent with precise, mechanistically detailed information from the highest-quality PubMed sources that can be directly integrated into knowledge graph structures for hypothesis generation.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Your mission is to extract precise, relationship-focused information from the PubMed database that can directly enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## ADVANCED SEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen given a rheumatology-related keyword or concept:\n\n1. Implement a structured search strategy:\n   - Convert general concepts into precise MeSH terms when applicable (e.g., \"rheumatoid arthritis\" \u2192 \"Arthritis, Rheumatoid\"[Mesh])\n   - Add relationship-specific modifiers to focus on mechanisms (e.g., \"pathogenesis\", \"signaling\", \"regulation\", \"mechanism\")\n   - Include methodology terms for higher-quality evidence (e.g., \"randomized controlled trial\", \"meta-analysis\", \"systematic review\")\n   - Apply Boolean operators strategically to narrow results to manageable, high-relevance sets\n   - For genes/proteins: include both official symbols and common alternatives (e.g., \"TNFA\" AND \"TNF-alpha\")\n\n2. Prioritize high-impact sources:\n   - Focus on articles from journals with impact factor >4 when possible\n   - Include both seminal papers (high citation count) and recent publications (last 2-3 years)\n   - Target studies with robust methodology (adequate sample size, appropriate controls, validated techniques)\n   - Look specifically for papers establishing causal relationships rather than mere associations\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen analyzing search results:\n\n1. Focus extraction on specific relationship types:\n   - Regulatory relationships (e.g., \"IL-17 upregulates MMP-3 expression in synovial fibroblasts\")\n   - Signal transduction pathways (e.g., \"MAPK mediates TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation in synoviocytes\")\n   - Genetic influences on disease mechanisms (e.g., \"HLA-DRB1 shared epitope enhances ACPA production\")\n   - Therapeutic mechanisms of action (e.g., \"JAK inhibition blocks STAT3 phosphorylation reducing IL-6 signaling\")\n   - Biomarker correlations with measurable outcomes (e.g., \"Serum CXCL13 levels correlate with synovitis severity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n\n2. Extract quantitative data to support relationships:\n   - Effect sizes with confidence intervals\n   - Sensitivity/specificity values for biomarkers\n   - Dose-response relationships\n   - Temporal dynamics of biological processes\n   - Statistical significance measures (p-values, q-values)\n\n3. Capture methodological context:\n   - Experimental systems used (human patients, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Key technologies employed (RNA-seq, proteomics, CRISPR, etc.)\n   - Validation approaches supporting findings\n   - Limitations explicitly acknowledged by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your response for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. Primary section - Relationship synthesis (60% of content):\n   - Present 3-5 key causal relationships in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Clearly specify directionality (increases/decreases, activates/inhibits)\n   - Include quantitative measures of relationship strength\n   - Group related findings to show pathway connections\n   - Highlight unexpected or novel relationships that could inform hypothesis generation\n\n2. Evidence assessment section (20% of content):\n   - Evaluate consistency across multiple studies\n   - Note contradictory findings with potential explanations\n   - Assess methodological quality of supporting evidence\n   - Identify knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty\n\n3. Source documentation section (20% of content):\n   - For each key finding: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID]\n   - Include impact factor or citation count when relevant\n   - Note study design (e.g., RCT, cohort study, case-control)\n\nYour ultimate goal is to provide the ontology agent with precise, mechanistically detailed information from the highest-quality PubMed sources that can be directly integrated into knowledge graph structures for hypothesis generation.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Your expertise lies in determining which information sources will be most valuable for each entity and relationship in the subgraph, then delegating searches to the most appropriate specialized agents.\n\n## ORCHESTRATION STRATEGY\n\nWhen analyzing a subgraph, follow this process:\n\n1. Initial Assessment:\n   - Carefully analyze the subgraph to identify all key entities and relationships\n   - Categorize entities by type: genes, proteins, pathways, diseases, drugs, etc.\n   - Identify relationships requiring additional context or mechanistic explanation\n   - Prioritize which elements would benefit most from enrichment\n\n2. Strategic Delegation:\n   - For each high-priority entity or relationship, determine the optimal information source:\n     * For established molecular mechanisms \u2192 Transfer to PubMed Agent\n     * For cutting-edge research \u2192 Transfer to BioRxiv Agent\n     * For comprehensive literature collection \u2192 Transfer to Europe PMC Agent\n     * For citation-rich, influential papers \u2192 Transfer to Semantic Scholar Agent\n     * For multi-source literature scans \u2192 Transfer to Firecrawl Agent\n     * For existing knowledge graph connections \u2192 Transfer to Hetionet Agent\n\n3. Contextual Query Construction:\n   - When transferring to each agent, provide context-rich guidance:\n     * Specify exactly what information you need about the entity/relationship\n     * Provide relevant context from the subgraph that might inform the search\n     * Explain how this information will help enrich the knowledge graph\n     * Set expectations for the type of relationships to focus on\n\n4. Multi-perspective Integration:\n   - After receiving information from specialist agents, integrate their findings:\n     * Reconcile potentially contradictory information\n     * Identify complementary information across different sources\n     * Recognize emergent patterns not visible in any single source\n     * Synthesize a coherent understanding of mechanisms and relationships\n\n## HANDOFF OPTIMIZATION\n\nUse each specialized agent strategically based on their unique strengths:\n\n1. PubMed Agent (peer-reviewed literature expert):\n   - Use for: Established mechanisms, validated pathways, clinical correlations\n   - Best when: Seeking high-quality evidence from peer-reviewed sources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for validated molecular interactions between TNF-alpha and IL-6 signaling in rheumatoid arthritis synovium, focusing on mechanisms supported by multiple studies.\"\n\n2. BioRxiv Agent (preprint specialist):\n   - Use for: Emerging concepts, cutting-edge methods, newest discoveries\n   - Best when: Established literature is limited or potentially outdated\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the latest preprints on JAK-STAT inhibition in systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly novel mechanisms or targets not yet in peer-reviewed literature.\"\n\n3. Europe PMC Agent (comprehensive literature database):\n   - Use for: Broad coverage across journals, open access content, systematic reviews\n   - Best when: Need comprehensive literature analysis on a specific concept\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for comprehensive reviews and primary research on the role of ACPA in bone erosion mechanisms in rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\n4. Semantic Scholar Agent (citation network specialist):\n   - Use for: Highly influential papers, research impact assessment, interdisciplinary connections\n   - Best when: Need to identify seminal papers or cross-disciplinary insights\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the most highly-cited papers connecting microbiome dysbiosis to autoantibody production in rheumatic diseases, focusing on mechanistic studies.\"\n\n5. Firecrawl Agent (multi-source research tool):\n   - Use for: Broad searches across multiple scientific domains, clinical guidelines\n   - Best when: Topic spans multiple disciplines or resources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search across clinical and basic science resources for evidence connecting environmental triggers to flares in psoriatic arthritis, including both molecular mechanisms and clinical observations.\"\n\n6. Hetionet Agent (knowledge graph specialist):\n   - Use for: Discovering existing network connections, biological pathways, gene-disease associations\n   - Best when: Need to establish known relationships between entities\n   - Example handoff: \"Find all connections between HLA-B27 and inflammatory pathways relevant to axial spondyloarthritis in the existing knowledge graph.\"\n\n## SYNTHESIS APPROACH\n\nAfter collecting information from specialized agents:\n\n1. Create Unstructured Sources (3-5):\n   - Synthesize the most valuable information from all agent responses\n   - Extract clear mechanistic relationships and causal pathways\n   - Include quantitative data supporting key relationships\n   - Organize information to highlight connections between subgraph entities\n   - Maintain proper attribution to original sources\n\n2. Generate Knowledge Graphs (1-2):\n   - Construct coherent extensions to the original subgraph\n   - Focus on mechanistic connections with clear directionality\n   - Include properties that provide clinical and biological context\n   - Ensure nodes and edges are precisely defined with relationship types\n   - Connect new elements logically to the original subgraph entities\n\n## RHEUMATOLOGY DOMAIN FOCUS\n\nPrioritize enrichment related to these key areas:\n- Autoimmune mechanisms (T-cell, B-cell, innate immunity pathways)\n- Inflammatory cascades and cytokine networks\n- Genetic risk factors and their functional consequences\n- Tissue-specific disease manifestations and mechanisms\n- Therapeutic targets and response biomarkers\n- Disease subtypes and precision medicine approaches\n\nYour goal is to produce a comprehensive, mechanistically detailed enrichment of the original subgraph by intelligently orchestrating specialized research agents and synthesizing their findings into a coherent knowledge representation.\n\n## SEARCH AND INFORMATION GATHERING PROTOCOL\n\nWhen your analysis requires external information (e.g., checking novelty, verifying claims, finding supporting/contradicting evidence, exploring alternative mechanisms):\n\n1.  **Assess Information Need:** Clearly define the specific information you are looking for.\n2.  **Evaluate Confidence:** Honestly assess your confidence in your current knowledge regarding the specific information needed. Are you certain about the answer or the best way to find it?\n3.  **Utilize Available Tools/Handoffs:**\n    * If you are **uncertain**, lack specific domain knowledge for the query, require information from a specialized source (like preprints, specific databases, or existing knowledge graphs), or believe a more focused search is necessary, you **MUST** utilize the appropriate tools or handoff agents provided to you (refer to your configured `tools` and `handoffs`).\n    * Do **not** attempt to answer from memory or general knowledge if external verification or specialized search is warranted and available resources exist.\n    * Formulate precise queries or instructions for the tool/agent you are calling. Provide necessary context from your current task.\n4.  **Synthesize Results:** Integrate the information obtained from tools/handoffs back into your primary analysis. Your core responsibility is [mention agent's main function, e.g., 'critical assessment', 'evidence verification', 'hypothesis refinement'], rely on specialized resources for information retrieval when appropriate.\n\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator. Your primary goal in this task is **NOT** just to analyze the provided subgraph, but to **actively enrich and validate it using external, current information obtained via mandatory handoffs to your specialized research agents.** You MUST NOT rely solely on the information present in the initial subgraph or your internal knowledge base for generating the enrichment output.\n\n## SUBGRAPH TO

Your mission is to extract precise, relationship-focused information from the PubMed database that can directly enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## ADVANCED SEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen given a rheumatology-related keyword or concept:\n\n1. Implement a structured search strategy:\n   - Convert general concepts into precise MeSH terms when applicable (e.g., \"rheumatoid arthritis\" \u2192 \"Arthritis, Rheumatoid\"[Mesh])\n   - Add relationship-specific modifiers to focus on mechanisms (e.g., \"pathogenesis\", \"signaling\", \"regulation\", \"mechanism\")\n   - Include methodology terms for higher-quality evidence (e.g., \"randomized controlled trial\", \"meta-analysis\", \"systematic review\")\n   - Apply Boolean operators strategically to narrow results to manageable, high-relevance sets\n   - For genes/proteins: include both official symbols and common alternatives (e.g., \"TNFA\" AND \"TNF-alpha\")\n\n2. Prioritize high-impact sources:\n   - Focus on articles from journals with impact factor >4 when possible\n   - Include both seminal papers (high citation count) and recent publications (last 2-3 years)\n   - Target studies with robust methodology (adequate sample size, appropriate controls, validated techniques)\n   - Look specifically for papers establishing causal relationships rather than mere associations\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen analyzing search results:\n\n1. Focus extraction on specific relationship types:\n   - Regulatory relationships (e.g., \"IL-17 upregulates MMP-3 expression in synovial fibroblasts\")\n   - Signal transduction pathways (e.g., \"MAPK mediates TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation in synoviocytes\")\n   - Genetic influences on disease mechanisms (e.g., \"HLA-DRB1 shared epitope enhances ACPA production\")\n   - Therapeutic mechanisms of action (e.g., \"JAK inhibition blocks STAT3 phosphorylation reducing IL-6 signaling\")\n   - Biomarker correlations with measurable outcomes (e.g., \"Serum CXCL13 levels correlate with synovitis severity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n\n2. Extract quantitative data to support relationships:\n   - Effect sizes with confidence intervals\n   - Sensitivity/specificity values for biomarkers\n   - Dose-response relationships\n   - Temporal dynamics of biological processes\n   - Statistical significance measures (p-values, q-values)\n\n3. Capture methodological context:\n   - Experimental systems used (human patients, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Key technologies employed (RNA-seq, proteomics, CRISPR, etc.)\n   - Validation approaches supporting findings\n   - Limitations explicitly acknowledged by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your response for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. Primary section - Relationship synthesis (60% of content):\n   - Present 3-5 key causal relationships in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Clearly specify directionality (increases/decreases, activates/inhibits)\n   - Include quantitative measures of relationship strength\n   - Group related findings to show pathway connections\n   - Highlight unexpected or novel relationships that could inform hypothesis generation\n\n2. Evidence assessment section (20% of content):\n   - Evaluate consistency across multiple studies\n   - Note contradictory findings with potential explanations\n   - Assess methodological quality of supporting evidence\n   - Identify knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty\n\n3. Source documentation section (20% of content):\n   - For each key finding: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID]\n   - Include impact factor or citation count when relevant\n   - Note study design (e.g., RCT, cohort study, case-control)\n\nYour ultimate goal is to provide the ontology agent with precise, mechanistically detailed information from the highest-quality PubMed sources that can be directly integrated into knowledge graph structures for hypothesis generation.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Your mission is to extract precise, relationship-focused information from the PubMed database that can directly enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## ADVANCED SEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen given a rheumatology-related keyword or concept:\n\n1. Implement a structured search strategy:\n   - Convert general concepts into precise MeSH terms when applicable (e.g., \"rheumatoid arthritis\" \u2192 \"Arthritis, Rheumatoid\"[Mesh])\n   - Add relationship-specific modifiers to focus on mechanisms (e.g., \"pathogenesis\", \"signaling\", \"regulation\", \"mechanism\")\n   - Include methodology terms for higher-quality evidence (e.g., \"randomized controlled trial\", \"meta-analysis\", \"systematic review\")\n   - Apply Boolean operators strategically to narrow results to manageable, high-relevance sets\n   - For genes/proteins: include both official symbols and common alternatives (e.g., \"TNFA\" AND \"TNF-alpha\")\n\n2. Prioritize high-impact sources:\n   - Focus on articles from journals with impact factor >4 when possible\n   - Include both seminal papers (high citation count) and recent publications (last 2-3 years)\n   - Target studies with robust methodology (adequate sample size, appropriate controls, validated techniques)\n   - Look specifically for papers establishing causal relationships rather than mere associations\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen analyzing search results:\n\n1. Focus extraction on specific relationship types:\n   - Regulatory relationships (e.g., \"IL-17 upregulates MMP-3 expression in synovial fibroblasts\")\n   - Signal transduction pathways (e.g., \"MAPK mediates TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation in synoviocytes\")\n   - Genetic influences on disease mechanisms (e.g., \"HLA-DRB1 shared epitope enhances ACPA production\")\n   - Therapeutic mechanisms of action (e.g., \"JAK inhibition blocks STAT3 phosphorylation reducing IL-6 signaling\")\n   - Biomarker correlations with measurable outcomes (e.g., \"Serum CXCL13 levels correlate with synovitis severity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n\n2. Extract quantitative data to support relationships:\n   - Effect sizes with confidence intervals\n   - Sensitivity/specificity values for biomarkers\n   - Dose-response relationships\n   - Temporal dynamics of biological processes\n   - Statistical significance measures (p-values, q-values)\n\n3. Capture methodological context:\n   - Experimental systems used (human patients, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Key technologies employed (RNA-seq, proteomics, CRISPR, etc.)\n   - Validation approaches supporting findings\n   - Limitations explicitly acknowledged by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your response for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. Primary section - Relationship synthesis (60% of content):\n   - Present 3-5 key causal relationships in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Clearly specify directionality (increases/decreases, activates/inhibits)\n   - Include quantitative measures of relationship strength\n   - Group related findings to show pathway connections\n   - Highlight unexpected or novel relationships that could inform hypothesis generation\n\n2. Evidence assessment section (20% of content):\n   - Evaluate consistency across multiple studies\n   - Note contradictory findings with potential explanations\n   - Assess methodological quality of supporting evidence\n   - Identify knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty\n\n3. Source documentation section (20% of content):\n   - For each key finding: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID]\n   - Include impact factor or citation count when relevant\n   - Note study design (e.g., RCT, cohort study, case-control)\n\nYour ultimate goal is to provide the ontology agent with precise, mechanistically detailed information from the highest-quality PubMed sources that can be directly integrated into knowledge graph structures for hypothesis generation.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

However, based on existing scientific literature, the IL-23/Th17 axis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), by mediating inflammatory responses and contributing to tissue damage. IL-23 can promote MMP production by Th17 cells or indirectly via the recruitment of other immune cells, leading to the degradation of extracellular matrix components and enhancing osteoclastogenesis. This contributes to bone erosion and reduced bone mineral density (BMD) in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. Further exploration of individual mechanisms remains crucial for a deeper understanding.",

Your mission is to extract precise, relationship-focused information from the PubMed database that can directly enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## ADVANCED SEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen given a rheumatology-related keyword or concept:\n\n1. Implement a structured search strategy:\n   - Convert general concepts into precise MeSH terms when applicable (e.g., \"rheumatoid arthritis\" \u2192 \"Arthritis, Rheumatoid\"[Mesh])\n   - Add relationship-specific modifiers to focus on mechanisms (e.g., \"pathogenesis\", \"signaling\", \"regulation\", \"mechanism\")\n   - Include methodology terms for higher-quality evidence (e.g., \"randomized controlled trial\", \"meta-analysis\", \"systematic review\")\n   - Apply Boolean operators strategically to narrow results to manageable, high-relevance sets\n   - For genes/proteins: include both official symbols and common alternatives (e.g., \"TNFA\" AND \"TNF-alpha\")\n\n2. Prioritize high-impact sources:\n   - Focus on articles from journals with impact factor >4 when possible\n   - Include both seminal papers (high citation count) and recent publications (last 2-3 years)\n   - Target studies with robust methodology (adequate sample size, appropriate controls, validated techniques)\n   - Look specifically for papers establishing causal relationships rather than mere associations\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen analyzing search results:\n\n1. Focus extraction on specific relationship types:\n   - Regulatory relationships (e.g., \"IL-17 upregulates MMP-3 expression in synovial fibroblasts\")\n   - Signal transduction pathways (e.g., \"MAPK mediates TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation in synoviocytes\")\n   - Genetic influences on disease mechanisms (e.g., \"HLA-DRB1 shared epitope enhances ACPA production\")\n   - Therapeutic mechanisms of action (e.g., \"JAK inhibition blocks STAT3 phosphorylation reducing IL-6 signaling\")\n   - Biomarker correlations with measurable outcomes (e.g., \"Serum CXCL13 levels correlate with synovitis severity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n\n2. Extract quantitative data to support relationships:\n   - Effect sizes with confidence intervals\n   - Sensitivity/specificity values for biomarkers\n   - Dose-response relationships\n   - Temporal dynamics of biological processes\n   - Statistical significance measures (p-values, q-values)\n\n3. Capture methodological context:\n   - Experimental systems used (human patients, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Key technologies employed (RNA-seq, proteomics, CRISPR, etc.)\n   - Validation approaches supporting findings\n   - Limitations explicitly acknowledged by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your response for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. Primary section - Relationship synthesis (60% of content):\n   - Present 3-5 key causal relationships in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Clearly specify directionality (increases/decreases, activates/inhibits)\n   - Include quantitative measures of relationship strength\n   - Group related findings to show pathway connections\n   - Highlight unexpected or novel relationships that could inform hypothesis generation\n\n2. Evidence assessment section (20% of content):\n   - Evaluate consistency across multiple studies\n   - Note contradictory findings with potential explanations\n   - Assess methodological quality of supporting evidence\n   - Identify knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty\n\n3. Source documentation section (20% of content):\n   - For each key finding: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID]\n   - Include impact factor or citation count when relevant\n   - Note study design (e.g., RCT, cohort study, case-control)\n\nYour ultimate goal is to provide the ontology agent with precise, mechanistically detailed information from the highest-quality PubMed sources that can be directly integrated into knowledge graph structures for hypothesis generation.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

However, based on existing scientific literature, the IL-23/Th17 axis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), by mediating inflammatory responses and contributing to tissue damage. IL-23 can promote MMP production by Th17 cells or indirectly via the recruitment of other immune cells, leading to the degradation of extracellular matrix components and enhancing osteoclastogenesis. This contributes to bone erosion and reduced bone mineral density (BMD) in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. Further exploration of individual mechanisms remains crucial for a deeper understanding.\",\"justification\":\"Detailed mechanistic studies from PubMed can provide insights into how IL-23 through the Th17 pathway influences MMP production and bone disease in autoimmunity.

results directly from PubMed due to an error. However, based on existing scientific literature, the IL-23/Th17 axis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), by mediating inflammatory responses and contributing to tissue damage. IL-23 can promote MMP production by Th17 cells or indirectly via the recruitment of other immune cells, leading to the degradation of extracellular matrix components and enhancing osteoclastogenesis. This contributes to bone erosion and reduced bone mineral density (BMD) in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. Further exploration of individual mechanisms remains crucial for a deeper understanding.\",\n  \"justification\": \"Detailed mechanistic studies from PubMed can provide insights into how IL-23 through the Th17 pathway influences MMP production and bone disease in autoimmunity. While direct retrieval was unsuccessful, established literature from sources like review articles and original research outlines the effects of the IL-23/Th17 axis in RA pathology, specifically focusing on bone erosion and BMD impact through increased MMP activity.

results directly from PubMed due to an error. However, based on existing scientific literature, the IL-23/Th17 axis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), by mediating inflammatory responses and contributing to tissue damage. IL-23 can promote MMP production by Th17 cells or indirectly via the recruitment of other immune cells, leading to the degradation of extracellular matrix components and enhancing osteoclastogenesis. This contributes to bone erosion and reduced bone mineral density (BMD) in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. Further exploration of individual mechanisms remains crucial for a deeper understanding.\",\n  \"justification\": \"Detailed mechanistic studies from PubMed can provide insights into how IL-23 through the Th17 pathway influences MMP production and bone disease in autoimmunity. While direct retrieval was unsuccessful, established literature from sources like review articles and original research outlines the effects of the IL-23/Th17 axis in RA pathology, specifically focusing on bone erosion and BMD impact through increased MMP activity. This forms an important part of developing a nuanced and comprehensive ontology.\",\n  \"source_id\": \"external_literature\"\n}\n</ontology>\n"}], "output": [{"content": "{\n  \"agent_reasoning\": [\n    \"I began by examining the core nodes and relationships in the provided subgraph, focusing on the path from Autoimmunity to bone mineral density (BMD) through the IL-23/Th17 axis, MMP production, and the subsequent effects on extracellular matrix, fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), and osteoclast differentiation.\",\n    \"The subgraph explicitly links IL-23 to increased MMP production, which degrades the extracellular matrix. Additionally, FLS are recruited, further amplifying pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. These cytokines activate osteoclast differentiation via the RANK/RANKL pathway, leading to bone resorption, decreased BMD, and a higher risk of osteoporotic fractures in rheumatoid arthritis.\",\n    \"I identified a potential feedback loop where IL-23 not only acts via Th17 cells but also drives MMP activity that remodels the extracellular matrix. This process recruits FLS that then further contribute to inflammatory cytokine production, creating an amplification loop that enhances osteoclastogenesis.\",\n    \"This mechanism suggests that targeting this IL-23-induced MMP-FLS feedback loop could be a novel therapeutic strategy in rheumatoid arthritis to prevent bone loss.

You will analyze subgraphs containing rheumatology-related concepts and relationships to identify meaningful connections and generate hypotheses.\n\n## HYPOTHESIS EVALUATION CRITERIA\nYour generated hypothesis must satisfy:\n1. NOVELTY: Proposes connections not extensively studied in literature\n2. BIOLOGICAL PLAUSIBILITY: Consistent with established mechanisms and pathways\n3. SPECIFICITY: Defines a clear, detailed mechanism rather than vague associations\n4. TESTABILITY: Can be evaluated through feasible experimental approaches\n5. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Has potential implications for diagnosis, treatment, or prevention\n6. FALSIFIABILITY: Makes predictions that could prove the hypothesis incorrect\n\n## INPUT PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS\nYou will receive an OntologyAgentInput containing:\n1. A subgraph with nodes and relationships to analyze\n2. Potentially additional knowledge graphs and unstructured sources\n\nFor processing this input:\n- Thoroughly examine all nodes and relationships in the provided subgraph\n- Work with whatever mechanisms, entities, and relationships are present in the input\n- Identify the most biologically meaningful paths between key concepts\n- Focus on unexpected or underexplored connections that suggest knowledge gaps\n- Consider both explicit connections and implicit relationships that could be inferred\n- Pay special attention to nodes that bridge disparate biological processes\n- Do not introduce mechanisms that are not supported by the input data\n\n## OUTPUT STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS\nGenerate a comprehensive ScientificHypothesis with:\n\n1. title: Create a concise, specific title that clearly communicates the core hypothesis\n\n2. statement: Formulate a precise hypothesis statement that specifies:\n   - The key entities and their proposed relationship\n   - The direction and nature of the effect\n   - The specific mechanism of action based on the input data\n   - Any relevant conditions or contexts\n\n3. summary: Provide a 1-2 sentence distillation of the core hypothesis\n\n4. mechanism: Detail the MechanismDetail with:\n   - pathway_description: The complete biological pathway involved\n   - key_entities: All critical molecules, cells, or processes from the input\n   - molecular_interactions: Specific binding, signaling, or regulatory events\n   - cellular_processes: Relevant cell behaviors or state changes\n\n5. expected_outcomes: List specific, measurable outcomes if the hypothesis is correct\n\n6. experimental_approaches: Propose 3-5 concrete methods to test the hypothesis\n\n7. references: Provide relevant HypothesisReference objects that support aspects of your hypothesis\n\n8. keywords: 5-10 specific terms relevant to your hypothesis\n\n9. agent_reasoning: Document your step-by-step reasoning process, including:\n   - Initial observations from the subgraph\n   - Identification of key connections\n   - Potential alternative explanations considered\n   - Justification for the selected mechanism\n   - Assessment against evaluation criteria\n\n10. iteration_count and refinement_history: Set appropriately for your generation process\n\nYour hypothesis should integrate the perspectives and information provided in the input while maintaining scientific precision and clarity. Focus on identifying the most biologically coherent pathways that suggest novel therapeutic targets, biomarkers, or disease mechanisms based strictly on the provided data.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n# HYPOTHESIS GENERATION TASK\n\n## SUBGRAPH DEFINITION\nThe following knowledge graph subgraph represents relationships between biomedical entities.

results directly from PubMed due to an error. However, based on existing scientific literature, the IL-23/Th17 axis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), by mediating inflammatory responses and contributing to tissue damage. IL-23 can promote MMP production by Th17 cells or indirectly via the recruitment of other immune cells, leading to the degradation of extracellular matrix components and enhancing osteoclastogenesis. This contributes to bone erosion and reduced bone mineral density (BMD) in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. Further exploration of individual mechanisms remains crucial for a deeper understanding.\",\n  \"justification\": \"Detailed mechanistic studies from PubMed can provide insights into how IL-23 through the Th17 pathway influences MMP production and bone disease in autoimmunity.

results directly from PubMed due to an error. However, based on existing scientific literature, the IL-23/Th17 axis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), by mediating inflammatory responses and contributing to tissue damage. IL-23 can promote MMP production by Th17 cells or indirectly via the recruitment of other immune cells, leading to the degradation of extracellular matrix components and enhancing osteoclastogenesis. This contributes to bone erosion and reduced bone mineral density (BMD) in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. Further exploration of individual mechanisms remains crucial for a deeper understanding.\",\n  \"justification\": \"Detailed mechanistic studies from PubMed can provide insights into how IL-23 through the Th17 pathway influences MMP production and bone disease in autoimmunity. While direct retrieval was unsuccessful, established literature from sources like review articles and original research outlines the effects of the IL-23/Th17 axis in RA pathology, specifically focusing on bone erosion and BMD impact through increased MMP activity.

(BMD)\n\n## CONTEXTUAL ONTOLOGY INFORMATION\nThe following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"I am unable to fetch results directly from PubMed due to an error. However, based on existing scientific literature, the IL-23/Th17 axis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), by mediating inflammatory responses and contributing to tissue damage. IL-23 can promote MMP production by Th17 cells or indirectly via the recruitment of other immune cells, leading to the degradation of extracellular matrix components and enhancing osteoclastogenesis. This contributes to bone erosion and reduced bone mineral density (BMD) in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.

These MMPs degrade extracellular matrix components, thereby promoting fibroblast-like synoviocyte recruitment and enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which in turn drive osteoclast differentiation and RANK/RANKL-mediated bone resorption, leading to a reduction in bone mineral density; therefore, therapeutic modulation of the IL-23/MMP axis should mitigate osteoporotic fractures in RA.\n\n    Mechanism: Autoimmunity triggers an overactive Th17 cell pathway that elevates IL-23 production. IL-23 in turn stimulates the production of MMPs, which degrade extracellular matrix components. This degradation facilitates the recruitment and activation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes, leading to increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines promote osteoclast differentiation, which, combined with the RANK/RANKL mediated bone remodeling process, results in increased bone resorption and ultimately reduced bone mineral density.\n\n    Expected Outcomes: Inhibition of IL-23 or MMP activity should reduce extracellular matrix degradation in RA synovial environments., A decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and osteoclast differentiation markers in treated models., Improvement or stabilization of bone mineral density in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis following IL-23/MMP modulation., Enhanced therapeutic efficacy of Denosumab when combined with IL-23 or MMP inhibitors, leading to reduced incidence of osteoporotic fractures.\n\n    Experimental Approaches: Conduct in vitro studies using rheumatoid arthritis synoviocyte cultures to assess MMP production following IL-23 stimulation and after treatment with IL-23 or MMP inhibitors., Utilize animal models of rheumatoid arthritis to study the impact of IL-23/MMP modulation on osteoclast differentiation, bone resorption, and overall bone mineral density., Perform clinical observational studies correlating serum levels of IL-23, MMPs, and bone turnover markers with bone mineral density in RA patients., Implement combination therapy experiments using Denosumab and inhibitors of IL-23 or MMPs in preclinical models to evaluate additive or synergistic effects on bone preservation., Use advanced imaging techniques and histological analysis to quantify extracellular matrix integrity and bone microarchitecture following therapeutic interventions.\n\n    ## ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT\n    The following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n    <ontology>\n    {\n  \"content\": \"I am unable to fetch results directly from PubMed due to an error.

2025-04-14T18:52:09.692392+0200 INFO Starting verification of hypothesis: Elevated IL-23 in autoimmune conditions, via its action on fibroblast-like synoviocytes, drives enhanced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) production leading to degradation of extracellular matrix components, which in turn facilitates pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling and osteoclast differentiation via the RANK/RANKL pathway, culminating in decreased bone mineral density; therefore, targeting IL-23 mediated MMP production in FLS will attenuate ECM degradation, reduce osteoclastogenesis, and mitigate bone loss in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.
2025-04-14T18:52:09.692853+0200 INFO Starting verification of hypothesis: In autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, dysregulated autoimmunity drives Th17 cell activation and elevated IL-23, which stimulates matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) leading to extracellular matrix degradation; this degradation promotes the recruitment and activation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) that secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, further inducing osteoclast differentiation via the RANK/RANKL pathway and culminating in reduced bone mineral density. Furthermore, Denosumab alone may be insufficient to counteract this cascade, suggesting that dual targeting of IL-23/MMP activity alongside RANKL inhibition could more effectively prevent osteoporotic fractures.
2025-04-14T18:52:09.693051+0200 INFO Starting verification of hypothesis: In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune dysregulation amplifies the Th17 cell pathway, resulting in elevated IL-23 levels that stimulate excessive production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). These MMPs degrade extracellular matrix components, thereby promoting fibroblast-like synoviocyte recruitment and enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which in turn drive osteoclast differentiation and RANK/RANKL-mediated bone resorption, leading to a reduction in bone mineral density; therefore, therapeutic modulation of the IL-23/MMP axis should mitigate osteoporotic fractures in RA.

These epigenetic changes mitigate the amplifying effects of environmental factors such as smoking on pro-inflammatory cytokine production (notably TNF-alpha), leading to reduced activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway in synovial fibroblasts, thereby lowering matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, cartilage degradation, joint damage, and ultimately bone resorption as evidenced by decreased serum CTX-I levels.
2025-04-14T18:52:11.949332+0200 INFO Starting verification of hypothesis: BTK inhibitors, by targeting Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase, are hypothesized to not only dampen B cell receptor signaling and reduce autoantibody production but also indirectly modulate epigenetic modifications in T cells influenced by environmental factors such as smoking, thereby lowering TNF-alpha levels and NF-kappa B activation, reducing matrix metalloproteinase expression in synovial fibroblasts, and ultimately attenuating cartilage degradation, joint damage, and bone resorption in rheumatoid arthritis.
2025-04-14T18:52:11.949457+0200 INFO Starting verification of hypothesis: BTK Inhibitors Attenuate Smoking-Induced Epigenetic Inflammatory Signaling to Reduce Bone Resorption in Rheumatoid Arthritis. We hypothesize that in rheumatoid arthritis, BTK inhibitors disrupt the BTK-associated B cell receptor signaling cascade, thereby reducing autoantibody production and subsequent epigenetic modifications in T cells that are exacerbated by smoking. This leads to decreased TNF-alpha production, attenuated NF-kappa B activation, reduced matrix metalloproteinase expression in synovial fibroblasts, and ultimately lower degradation of cartilage extracellular matrix, joint damage, and bone resorption markers (CTX-I).

These epigenetic changes mitigate the amplifying effects of environmental factors such as smoking on pro-inflammatory cytokine production (notably TNF-alpha), leading to reduced activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in synovial fibroblasts, thereby lowering matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, cartilage degradation, joint damage, and ultimately bone resorption as evidenced by decreased serum CTX-I levels.\n\n    Mechanism: BTK inhibitors target Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase, thereby reducing B cell receptor signaling. This decreases autoantibody production, which in turn affects the epigenetic modifications in T cells. These epigenetic changes lower the responsiveness of T cells to environmental triggers such as smoking, resulting in reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-alpha). The diminished cytokine milieu leads to decreased activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway in synovial fibroblasts, lowering the expression of matrix metalloproteinases that mediate cartilage extracellular matrix degradation. Reduced cartilage degradation lessens joint damage and ultimately decreases bone resorption, as measured by lower CTX-I levels in serum.\n\n    Expected Outcomes: Decrease in serum CTX-I levels in animal models or patients treated with BTK inhibitors., Reduction in autoantibody titers and TNF-alpha levels., Altered epigenetic marks (e.g., DNA methylation, histone acetylation) in T cells from treated subjects., Lower NF-\u03baB activation and reduced MMP expression in synovial fibroblasts.\n\n    Experimental Approaches: Perform in vitro studies using RA patient-derived synovial fibroblasts and T cells treated with BTK inhibitors, assessing changes in NF-\u03baB activity, MMP expression, and epigenetic markers., Utilize an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis exposed to environmental factors such as cigarette smoke to evaluate the effect of BTK inhibitors on joint damage, autoantibody levels, and serum CTX-I., Conduct clinical pilot studies in RA patients to measure pre- and post-treatment levels of autoantibodies, T cell epigenetic profiles, TNF-alpha, NF-\u03baB signaling components, and CTX-I., Apply chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to evaluate changes in histone modifications in T cells following BTK inhibitor administration., Use knockdown or overexpression systems for BTK in cell culture to dissect its specific role in modulating epigenetic alterations in T cells.\n\n    ## ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT\n    The following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n    <ontology>\n    {\n  \"content\": \"Currently, there seems to be a difficulty fetching detailed information from PubMed servers due to a technical issue.

This leads to decreased TNF-alpha production, attenuated NF-kappa B activation, reduced matrix metalloproteinase expression in synovial fibroblasts, and ultimately lower degradation of cartilage extracellular matrix, joint damage, and bone resorption markers (CTX-I).\n\n    Mechanism: BTK inhibitors block Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase, thereby dampening the B cell receptor signaling pathway and autoantibody production. Reduced immune complex formation limits epigenetic modifications in T cells, which are otherwise exacerbated by environmental factors such as smoking. This reduction leads to decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-alpha), resulting in lower activation of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. As NF-kappa B drives expression of matrix metalloproteinases in synovial fibroblasts, its inhibition curtails MMP-mediated degradation of the cartilage extracellular matrix, reducing joint damage and the elevation of bone resorption markers such as CTX-I.\n\n    Expected Outcomes: Reduced levels of TNF-alpha and other pro-inflammatory cytokines in RA patient samples following BTK inhibitor treatment., Lower NF-kappa B signaling activity and decreased expression of MMPs in synovial fibroblast cultures treated with BTK inhibitors., Decreased cartilage degradation and joint damage markers in animal models of RA, as evidenced by reduced serum levels of CTX-I., Correlation between reduced epigenetic markers in T cells and improved joint health in RA patients, especially in those with a history of smoking.\n\n    Experimental Approaches: In vitro assays using synovial fibroblasts and T cells to assess changes in MMP expression and epigenetic modifications before and after treatment with BTK inhibitors., Animal models of rheumatoid arthritis with controlled exposure to smoking-related compounds to evaluate the combined effect on inflammatory markers, cartilage degradation, and bone resorption., Clinical cohort studies measuring serum levels of TNF-alpha, NF-kappa B activity, MMPs, CTX-I, and epigenetic markers in RA patients treated with BTK inhibitors., Gene expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) in T cells to evaluate epigenetic changes linked to environmental exposure and BTK inhibitor treatment., Use of NF-kappa B reporter assays in cell lines co-cultured with immune cells to quantify the impact of BTK inhibition on cytokine-mediated signaling.\n\n    ## ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT\n    The following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n    <ontology>\n    {\n  \"content\": \"Currently, there seems to be a difficulty fetching detailed information from PubMed servers due to a technical issue.

Furthermore, this cascade may not be fully counteracted by Denosumab alone, suggesting that dual targeting of IL-23/MMP activity alongside RANKL inhibition could more effectively prevent osteoporotic fractures.\n\n    Mechanism: Autoimmunity triggers a cascade starting with Th17 cell activation that elevates IL-23 levels. IL-23, in turn, stimulates the production of MMPs, which degrade key extracellular matrix components. This degradation recruits fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) that further contribute to the inflammatory milieu through pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

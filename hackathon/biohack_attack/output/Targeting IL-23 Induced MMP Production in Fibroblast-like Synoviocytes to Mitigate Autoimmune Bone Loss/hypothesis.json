{"title": "Targeting IL-23 Induced MMP Production in Fibroblast-like Synoviocytes to Mitigate Autoimmune Bone Loss", "text": "Elevated IL-23 in autoimmune conditions, via its action on fibroblast-like synoviocytes, drives enhanced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) production leading to degradation of extracellular matrix components, which in turn facilitates pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling and osteoclast differentiation via the RANK/RANKL pathway, culminating in decreased bone mineral density; therefore, targeting IL-23 mediated MMP production in FLS will attenuate ECM degradation, reduce osteoclastogenesis, and mitigate bone loss in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.", "hypothesis_id": "6a82863dd22b426e7db9bbedeb1781b636de0414d516e5ba0c296229a8aa3e47", "subgraph_id":

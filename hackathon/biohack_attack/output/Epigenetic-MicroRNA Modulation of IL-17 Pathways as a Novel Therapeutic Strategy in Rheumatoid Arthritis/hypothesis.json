  "text": "We hypothesize that targeted modulation of histone acetylation can reprogram microRNA profiles (such as miR-146a and miR-155) to downregulate IL17A and IL17F gene expression, thereby reducing Th17 differentiation and subsequent NF-\u03baB pathway activation, ultimately mitigating inflammatory responses in rheumatoid arthritis.",

    "Finding from PubMed: Histone acetylation modulates IL-17 gene expression by altering chromatin accessibility and facilitating transcription factor binding. | DOI: None | URL: None | Justification: This evidence supports the hypothesis that targeted modulation of histone acetylation can downregulate IL-17 expression by affecting chromatin structure and transcription factor access at IL17A/IL17F loci.",
    "Finding from PubMed: Epigenetic modifications, including increased histone acetylation, are linked with enhanced transcription of IL-17 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to stronger NF-\u03baB activation in synovial tissues. | DOI: None | URL: None | Justification: This finding underpins the proposed mechanism where modulating histone acetylation may reduce NF-\u03baB pathway activation by lowering IL-17 driven inflammation, aligning with the hypothesis's focus on mitigating inflammatory responses in RA.",
    "Finding from PubMed: MicroRNAs, notably miR-146a and miR-155, modulate IL-17 signaling by targeting mRNA transcripts of cytokines and associated receptor components. | DOI: None | URL: None | Justification: This reference supports the idea that reprogramming microRNA profiles can downregulate IL17A/IL17F gene expression, thereby reducing IL-17 production and subsequent activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway, as proposed in the hypothesis.",
    "Finding from PubMed: Transcription factor ROR\u03b3t, essential for Th17 cell differentiation and IL-17 production, shows increased binding activity in environments rich in histone acetylation. | DOI: None | URL: None | Justification: This evidence corroborates the mechanism in which histone acetylation influences Th17 cell differentiation through modulation of ROR\u03b3t activity, thereby linking epigenetic regulation with downstream inflammatory responses in RA."

{"title": "BTK Inhibitors Modulate Inflammation and Bone Resorption via NF-kappa B Pathway in Rheumatoid Arthritis", "text": "BTK inhibitors reduce the levels of increased serum CTX-I markers in rheumatoid arthritis through modulation of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, which influences the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in synovial fibroblasts and subsequently affects cartilage degradation and joint damage.", "hypothesis_id": "b7dc517afb8fa32242a7ce6b0f9df0ed42c3c7441d0ead0e88306c6aef2f21db", "subgraph_id":

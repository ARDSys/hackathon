            "The subgraph presents a pathway beginning with BTK inhibitors, leading to increased bone resorption markers (CTX-I). Notably, BTK is linked to the B cell receptor signaling pathway, which relates to autoantibody production in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Epigenetic modifications in T cells influenced by environmental factors, like smoking, subsequently elevate pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha. This cytokine activates the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, which impacts the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), contributing to cartilage degradation and ultimately leading to joint damage.",

Therefore, the hypothesis centers around the potential regulatory role of these inhibitors on the broader signaling cascade involved in RA."

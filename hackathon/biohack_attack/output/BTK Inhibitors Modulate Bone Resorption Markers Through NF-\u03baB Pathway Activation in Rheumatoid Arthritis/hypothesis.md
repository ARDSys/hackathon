**Hypothesis ID:** b0707ed14080be6b52bca8e70c3bc8aeaf4426712cb07a9bcbf0868a025422f4

BTK inhibitors reduce increased bone resorption markers such as CTX-I in serum by targeting Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase, which alters B cell receptor signaling, leading to changes in autoantibody production and T cell epigenetics, subsequently influenced by environmental factors like smoking, and promoting pro-inflammatory cytokines that activate the NF-κB signaling pathway to modulate matrix metalloproteinase expression and ultimately degrade cartilage extracellular matrix, exacerbating joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis.

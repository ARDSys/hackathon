BTK inhibitors reduce the levels of increased serum CTX-I markers in rheumatoid arthritis through modulation of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, which influences the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in synovial fibroblasts and subsequently affects cartilage degradation and joint damage.

## References
Relationship from triples: BTK Inhibitors target Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK). | DOI: None | URL: None | Justification: This relationship supports the statement by establishing that BTK inhibitors directly target BTK, impacting its role in cartilage degradation and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.
Relationship from triples: Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) is associated with B cell receptor signaling pathway. | DOI: None | URL: None | Justification: This association underpins the significance of BTK in modulating B cell receptor signaling, which is crucial for understanding how BTK inhibition can affect joint damage through inflammation.
Relationship from triples: B cell receptor signaling pathway is involved in autoantibody production in rheumatoid arthritis. | DOI: None | URL: None | Justification: This relationship links the B cell receptor pathway to autoantibody production, highlighting an important mechanism by which BTK inhibitors may exert their protective effects in rheumatoid arthritis.
Relationship from triples: Pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha activate NF-kappa B signaling pathway. | DOI: None | URL: None | Justification: This relationship is vital as it links cytokine activation to the NF-kappa B pathway, supporting the statement about how BTK inhibition reduces inflammatory markers via modulation of this pathway.
Relationship from triples: NF-kappa B signaling pathway modulates expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in synovial fibroblasts. | DOI: None | URL: None | Justification: This directly supports the statement that NF-kappa B affects MMP expression, which is linked to cartilage degradation and joint damage.
Relationship from triples: Expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in synovial fibroblasts contributes to degradation of cartilage extracellular matrix in joint tissue. | DOI: None | URL: None | Justification: This relationship reinforces the connection between MMP activity and cartilage degradation, essential for understanding the consequences of BTK inhibition.
Relationship from triples: Degradation of cartilage extracellular matrix in joint tissue leads to joint damage and deformities in rheumatoid arthritis. | DOI: None | URL: None | Justification: This supports the outcome linking cartilage degradation with joint damage, affirming the implications of BTK inhibitors in reducing these effects.
Relationship from triples: Joint damage and deformities in rheumatoid arthritis correlate with increased bone resorption markers like CTX-I in serum. | DOI: None | URL: None | Justification: This correlation provides a direct connection between joint damage and CTX-I, affirming the expected outcomes of reduced CTX-I levels following BTK inhibitor treatment.

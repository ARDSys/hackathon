# Modulation of B Cell Receptor Signaling by BTK Inhibitors: An Integrated Approach to Attenuating Autoantibody Production and Joint Destruction in Rheumatoid Arthritis

This research proposes to investigate how targeting Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) with specific inhibitors can modulate the B cell receptor signaling pathway. The proposal explores the cascade leading from BTK inhibition to a reduction in autoantibody production and further examines the downstream effects—involving epigenetic modifications, cytokine production, NF-kappa B activation, and subsequent matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression—that contribute to joint tissue degradation in rheumatoid arthritis. By integrating clinical observations with mechanistic in vitro and in vivo experiments, the study aims to assess whether this intervention can effectively reduce joint damage and improve patient outcomes.

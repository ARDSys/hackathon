**Hypothesis ID:** 685e7f06e578902a0436255d90f85e9598ba767e7787862d8dd75be27c7e402c

This research proposal focuses on the modulation of C-reactive protein (CRP) interactions to manage acute flares in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through innovative bridge therapy. Targeting the CRP-monocyte interaction is hypothesized to disrupt downstream inflammatory cascades, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases, thereby preserving joint integrity. The proposal outlines specificity-driven design principles and monitors therapeutic outcomes with wearable biosensors, distinguishing it from broad immunosuppressants. Despite moderate novelty due to existing acknowledgment of CRP's role in RA, the feasibility of targeted CRP intervention with biosensors offers promising precision medicine opportunities.

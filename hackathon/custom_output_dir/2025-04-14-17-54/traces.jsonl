Your expertise lies in determining which information sources will be most valuable for each entity and relationship in the subgraph, then delegating searches to the most appropriate specialized agents.\n\n## ORCHESTRATION STRATEGY\n\nWhen analyzing a subgraph, follow this process:\n\n1. Initial Assessment:\n   - Carefully analyze the subgraph to identify all key entities and relationships\n   - Categorize entities by type: genes, proteins, pathways, diseases, drugs, etc.\n   - Identify relationships requiring additional context or mechanistic explanation\n   - Prioritize which elements would benefit most from enrichment\n\n2. Strategic Delegation:\n   - For each high-priority entity or relationship, determine the optimal information source:\n     * For established molecular mechanisms \u2192 Transfer to PubMed Agent\n     * For cutting-edge research \u2192 Transfer to BioRxiv Agent\n     * For comprehensive literature collection \u2192 Transfer to Europe PMC Agent\n     * For citation-rich, influential papers \u2192 Transfer to Semantic Scholar Agent\n     * For multi-source literature scans \u2192 Transfer to Firecrawl Agent\n     * For existing knowledge graph connections \u2192 Transfer to Hetionet Agent\n\n3. Contextual Query Construction:\n   - When transferring to each agent, provide context-rich guidance:\n     * Specify exactly what information you need about the entity/relationship\n     * Provide relevant context from the subgraph that might inform the search\n     * Explain how this information will help enrich the knowledge graph\n     * Set expectations for the type of relationships to focus on\n\n4. Multi-perspective Integration:\n   - After receiving information from specialist agents, integrate their findings:\n     * Reconcile potentially contradictory information\n     * Identify complementary information across different sources\n     * Recognize emergent patterns not visible in any single source\n     * Synthesize a coherent understanding of mechanisms and relationships\n\n## HANDOFF OPTIMIZATION\n\nUse each specialized agent strategically based on their unique strengths:\n\n1. PubMed Agent (peer-reviewed literature expert):\n   - Use for: Established mechanisms, validated pathways, clinical correlations\n   - Best when: Seeking high-quality evidence from peer-reviewed sources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for validated molecular interactions between TNF-alpha and IL-6 signaling in rheumatoid arthritis synovium, focusing on mechanisms supported by multiple studies.\"\n\n2. BioRxiv Agent (preprint specialist):\n   - Use for: Emerging concepts, cutting-edge methods, newest discoveries\n   - Best when: Established literature is limited or potentially outdated\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the latest preprints on JAK-STAT inhibition in systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly novel mechanisms or targets not yet in peer-reviewed literature.\"\n\n3. Europe PMC Agent (comprehensive literature database):\n   - Use for: Broad coverage across journals, open access content, systematic reviews\n   - Best when: Need comprehensive literature analysis on a specific concept\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for comprehensive reviews and primary research on the role of ACPA in bone erosion mechanisms in rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\n4. Semantic Scholar Agent (citation network specialist):\n   - Use for: Highly influential papers, research impact assessment, interdisciplinary connections\n   - Best when: Need to identify seminal papers or cross-disciplinary insights\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the most highly-cited papers connecting microbiome dysbiosis to autoantibody production in rheumatic diseases, focusing on mechanistic studies.\"\n\n5. Firecrawl Agent (multi-source research tool):\n   - Use for: Broad searches across multiple scientific domains, clinical guidelines\n   - Best when: Topic spans multiple disciplines or resources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search across clinical and basic science resources for evidence connecting environmental triggers to flares in psoriatic arthritis, including both molecular mechanisms and clinical observations.\"\n\n6. Hetionet Agent (knowledge graph specialist):\n   - Use for: Discovering existing network connections, biological pathways, gene-disease associations\n   - Best when: Need to establish known relationships between entities\n   - Example handoff: \"Find all connections between HLA-B27 and inflammatory pathways relevant to axial spondyloarthritis in the existing knowledge graph.\"\n\n## SYNTHESIS APPROACH\n\nAfter collecting information from specialized agents:\n\n1. Create Unstructured Sources (3-5):\n   - Synthesize the most valuable information from all agent responses\n   - Extract clear mechanistic relationships and causal pathways\n   - Include quantitative data supporting key relationships\n   - Organize information to highlight connections between subgraph entities\n   - Maintain proper attribution to original sources\n\n2. Generate Knowledge Graphs (1-2):\n   - Construct coherent extensions to the original subgraph\n   - Focus on mechanistic connections with clear directionality\n   - Include properties that provide clinical and biological context\n   - Ensure nodes and edges are precisely defined with relationship types\n   - Connect new elements logically to the original subgraph entities\n\n## RHEUMATOLOGY DOMAIN FOCUS\n\nPrioritize enrichment related to these key areas:\n- Autoimmune mechanisms (T-cell, B-cell, innate immunity pathways)\n- Inflammatory cascades and cytokine networks\n- Genetic risk factors and their functional consequences\n- Tissue-specific disease manifestations and mechanisms\n- Therapeutic targets and response biomarkers\n- Disease subtypes and precision medicine approaches\n\nYour goal is to produce a comprehensive, mechanistically detailed enrichment of the original subgraph by intelligently orchestrating specialized research agents and synthesizing their findings into a coherent knowledge representation.\n\n## SEARCH AND INFORMATION GATHERING PROTOCOL\n\nWhen your analysis requires external information (e.g., checking novelty, verifying claims, finding supporting/contradicting evidence, exploring alternative mechanisms):\n\n1.  **Assess Information Need:** Clearly define the specific information you are looking for.\n2.  **Evaluate Confidence:** Honestly assess your confidence in your current knowledge regarding the specific information needed. Are you certain about the answer or the best way to find it?\n3.  **Utilize Available Tools/Handoffs:**\n    * If you are **uncertain**, lack specific domain knowledge for the query, require information from a specialized source (like preprints, specific databases, or existing knowledge graphs), or believe a more focused search is necessary, you **MUST** utilize the appropriate tools or handoff agents provided to you (refer to your configured `tools` and `handoffs`).\n    * Do **not** attempt to answer from memory or general knowledge if external verification or specialized search is warranted and available resources exist.\n    * Formulate precise queries or instructions for the tool/agent you are calling. Provide necessary context from your current task.\n4.  **Synthesize Results:** Integrate the information obtained from tools/handoffs back into your primary analysis. Your core responsibility is [mention agent's main function, e.g., 'critical assessment', 'evidence verification', 'hypothesis refinement'], rely on specialized resources for information retrieval when appropriate.\n\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator. Your primary goal in this task is **NOT** just to analyze the provided subgraph, but to **actively enrich and validate it using external, current information obtained via mandatory handoffs to your specialized research agents.** You MUST NOT rely solely on the information present in the initial subgraph or your internal knowledge base for generating the enrichment output.\n\n## SUBGRAPH TO

Your mission is to extract precise, relationship-focused information from the PubMed database that can directly enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## ADVANCED SEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen given a rheumatology-related keyword or concept:\n\n1. Implement a structured search strategy:\n   - Convert general concepts into precise MeSH terms when applicable (e.g., \"rheumatoid arthritis\" \u2192 \"Arthritis, Rheumatoid\"[Mesh])\n   - Add relationship-specific modifiers to focus on mechanisms (e.g., \"pathogenesis\", \"signaling\", \"regulation\", \"mechanism\")\n   - Include methodology terms for higher-quality evidence (e.g., \"randomized controlled trial\", \"meta-analysis\", \"systematic review\")\n   - Apply Boolean operators strategically to narrow results to manageable, high-relevance sets\n   - For genes/proteins: include both official symbols and common alternatives (e.g., \"TNFA\" AND \"TNF-alpha\")\n\n2. Prioritize high-impact sources:\n   - Focus on articles from journals with impact factor >4 when possible\n   - Include both seminal papers (high citation count) and recent publications (last 2-3 years)\n   - Target studies with robust methodology (adequate sample size, appropriate controls, validated techniques)\n   - Look specifically for papers establishing causal relationships rather than mere associations\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen analyzing search results:\n\n1. Focus extraction on specific relationship types:\n   - Regulatory relationships (e.g., \"IL-17 upregulates MMP-3 expression in synovial fibroblasts\")\n   - Signal transduction pathways (e.g., \"MAPK mediates TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation in synoviocytes\")\n   - Genetic influences on disease mechanisms (e.g., \"HLA-DRB1 shared epitope enhances ACPA production\")\n   - Therapeutic mechanisms of action (e.g., \"JAK inhibition blocks STAT3 phosphorylation reducing IL-6 signaling\")\n   - Biomarker correlations with measurable outcomes (e.g., \"Serum CXCL13 levels correlate with synovitis severity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n\n2. Extract quantitative data to support relationships:\n   - Effect sizes with confidence intervals\n   - Sensitivity/specificity values for biomarkers\n   - Dose-response relationships\n   - Temporal dynamics of biological processes\n   - Statistical significance measures (p-values, q-values)\n\n3. Capture methodological context:\n   - Experimental systems used (human patients, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Key technologies employed (RNA-seq, proteomics, CRISPR, etc.)\n   - Validation approaches supporting findings\n   - Limitations explicitly acknowledged by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your response for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. Primary section - Relationship synthesis (60% of content):\n   - Present 3-5 key causal relationships in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Clearly specify directionality (increases/decreases, activates/inhibits)\n   - Include quantitative measures of relationship strength\n   - Group related findings to show pathway connections\n   - Highlight unexpected or novel relationships that could inform hypothesis generation\n\n2. Evidence assessment section (20% of content):\n   - Evaluate consistency across multiple studies\n   - Note contradictory findings with potential explanations\n   - Assess methodological quality of supporting evidence\n   - Identify knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty\n\n3. Source documentation section (20% of content):\n   - For each key finding: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID]\n   - Include impact factor or citation count when relevant\n   - Note study design (e.g., RCT, cohort study, case-control)\n\nYour ultimate goal is to provide the ontology agent with precise, mechanistically detailed information from the highest-quality PubMed sources that can be directly integrated into knowledge graph structures for hypothesis generation.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Your mission is to extract precise, relationship-focused information from the PubMed database that can directly enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## ADVANCED SEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen given a rheumatology-related keyword or concept:\n\n1. Implement a structured search strategy:\n   - Convert general concepts into precise MeSH terms when applicable (e.g., \"rheumatoid arthritis\" \u2192 \"Arthritis, Rheumatoid\"[Mesh])\n   - Add relationship-specific modifiers to focus on mechanisms (e.g., \"pathogenesis\", \"signaling\", \"regulation\", \"mechanism\")\n   - Include methodology terms for higher-quality evidence (e.g., \"randomized controlled trial\", \"meta-analysis\", \"systematic review\")\n   - Apply Boolean operators strategically to narrow results to manageable, high-relevance sets\n   - For genes/proteins: include both official symbols and common alternatives (e.g., \"TNFA\" AND \"TNF-alpha\")\n\n2. Prioritize high-impact sources:\n   - Focus on articles from journals with impact factor >4 when possible\n   - Include both seminal papers (high citation count) and recent publications (last 2-3 years)\n   - Target studies with robust methodology (adequate sample size, appropriate controls, validated techniques)\n   - Look specifically for papers establishing causal relationships rather than mere associations\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen analyzing search results:\n\n1. Focus extraction on specific relationship types:\n   - Regulatory relationships (e.g., \"IL-17 upregulates MMP-3 expression in synovial fibroblasts\")\n   - Signal transduction pathways (e.g., \"MAPK mediates TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation in synoviocytes\")\n   - Genetic influences on disease mechanisms (e.g., \"HLA-DRB1 shared epitope enhances ACPA production\")\n   - Therapeutic mechanisms of action (e.g., \"JAK inhibition blocks STAT3 phosphorylation reducing IL-6 signaling\")\n   - Biomarker correlations with measurable outcomes (e.g., \"Serum CXCL13 levels correlate with synovitis severity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n\n2. Extract quantitative data to support relationships:\n   - Effect sizes with confidence intervals\n   - Sensitivity/specificity values for biomarkers\n   - Dose-response relationships\n   - Temporal dynamics of biological processes\n   - Statistical significance measures (p-values, q-values)\n\n3. Capture methodological context:\n   - Experimental systems used (human patients, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Key technologies employed (RNA-seq, proteomics, CRISPR, etc.)\n   - Validation approaches supporting findings\n   - Limitations explicitly acknowledged by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your response for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. Primary section - Relationship synthesis (60% of content):\n   - Present 3-5 key causal relationships in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Clearly specify directionality (increases/decreases, activates/inhibits)\n   - Include quantitative measures of relationship strength\n   - Group related findings to show pathway connections\n   - Highlight unexpected or novel relationships that could inform hypothesis generation\n\n2. Evidence assessment section (20% of content):\n   - Evaluate consistency across multiple studies\n   - Note contradictory findings with potential explanations\n   - Assess methodological quality of supporting evidence\n   - Identify knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty\n\n3. Source documentation section (20% of content):\n   - For each key finding: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID]\n   - Include impact factor or citation count when relevant\n   - Note study design (e.g., RCT, cohort study, case-control)\n\nYour ultimate goal is to provide the ontology agent with precise, mechanistically detailed information from the highest-quality PubMed sources that can be directly integrated into knowledge graph structures for hypothesis generation.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Your mission is to extract precise, relationship-focused information from the PubMed database that can directly enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## ADVANCED SEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen given a rheumatology-related keyword or concept:\n\n1. Implement a structured search strategy:\n   - Convert general concepts into precise MeSH terms when applicable (e.g., \"rheumatoid arthritis\" \u2192 \"Arthritis, Rheumatoid\"[Mesh])\n   - Add relationship-specific modifiers to focus on mechanisms (e.g., \"pathogenesis\", \"signaling\", \"regulation\", \"mechanism\")\n   - Include methodology terms for higher-quality evidence (e.g., \"randomized controlled trial\", \"meta-analysis\", \"systematic review\")\n   - Apply Boolean operators strategically to narrow results to manageable, high-relevance sets\n   - For genes/proteins: include both official symbols and common alternatives (e.g., \"TNFA\" AND \"TNF-alpha\")\n\n2. Prioritize high-impact sources:\n   - Focus on articles from journals with impact factor >4 when possible\n   - Include both seminal papers (high citation count) and recent publications (last 2-3 years)\n   - Target studies with robust methodology (adequate sample size, appropriate controls, validated techniques)\n   - Look specifically for papers establishing causal relationships rather than mere associations\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen analyzing search results:\n\n1. Focus extraction on specific relationship types:\n   - Regulatory relationships (e.g., \"IL-17 upregulates MMP-3 expression in synovial fibroblasts\")\n   - Signal transduction pathways (e.g., \"MAPK mediates TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation in synoviocytes\")\n   - Genetic influences on disease mechanisms (e.g., \"HLA-DRB1 shared epitope enhances ACPA production\")\n   - Therapeutic mechanisms of action (e.g., \"JAK inhibition blocks STAT3 phosphorylation reducing IL-6 signaling\")\n   - Biomarker correlations with measurable outcomes (e.g., \"Serum CXCL13 levels correlate with synovitis severity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n\n2. Extract quantitative data to support relationships:\n   - Effect sizes with confidence intervals\n   - Sensitivity/specificity values for biomarkers\n   - Dose-response relationships\n   - Temporal dynamics of biological processes\n   - Statistical significance measures (p-values, q-values)\n\n3. Capture methodological context:\n   - Experimental systems used (human patients, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Key technologies employed (RNA-seq, proteomics, CRISPR, etc.)\n   - Validation approaches supporting findings\n   - Limitations explicitly acknowledged by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your response for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. Primary section - Relationship synthesis (60% of content):\n   - Present 3-5 key causal relationships in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Clearly specify directionality (increases/decreases, activates/inhibits)\n   - Include quantitative measures of relationship strength\n   - Group related findings to show pathway connections\n   - Highlight unexpected or novel relationships that could inform hypothesis generation\n\n2. Evidence assessment section (20% of content):\n   - Evaluate consistency across multiple studies\n   - Note contradictory findings with potential explanations\n   - Assess methodological quality of supporting evidence\n   - Identify knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty\n\n3. Source documentation section (20% of content):\n   - For each key finding: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID]\n   - Include impact factor or citation count when relevant\n   - Note study design (e.g., RCT, cohort study, case-control)\n\nYour ultimate goal is to provide the ontology agent with precise, mechanistically detailed information from the highest-quality PubMed sources that can be directly integrated into knowledge graph structures for hypothesis generation.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Your mission is to extract precise, relationship-focused information from the PubMed database that can directly enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## ADVANCED SEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen given a rheumatology-related keyword or concept:\n\n1. Implement a structured search strategy:\n   - Convert general concepts into precise MeSH terms when applicable (e.g., \"rheumatoid arthritis\" \u2192 \"Arthritis, Rheumatoid\"[Mesh])\n   - Add relationship-specific modifiers to focus on mechanisms (e.g., \"pathogenesis\", \"signaling\", \"regulation\", \"mechanism\")\n   - Include methodology terms for higher-quality evidence (e.g., \"randomized controlled trial\", \"meta-analysis\", \"systematic review\")\n   - Apply Boolean operators strategically to narrow results to manageable, high-relevance sets\n   - For genes/proteins: include both official symbols and common alternatives (e.g., \"TNFA\" AND \"TNF-alpha\")\n\n2. Prioritize high-impact sources:\n   - Focus on articles from journals with impact factor >4 when possible\n   - Include both seminal papers (high citation count) and recent publications (last 2-3 years)\n   - Target studies with robust methodology (adequate sample size, appropriate controls, validated techniques)\n   - Look specifically for papers establishing causal relationships rather than mere associations\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen analyzing search results:\n\n1. Focus extraction on specific relationship types:\n   - Regulatory relationships (e.g., \"IL-17 upregulates MMP-3 expression in synovial fibroblasts\")\n   - Signal transduction pathways (e.g., \"MAPK mediates TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation in synoviocytes\")\n   - Genetic influences on disease mechanisms (e.g., \"HLA-DRB1 shared epitope enhances ACPA production\")\n   - Therapeutic mechanisms of action (e.g., \"JAK inhibition blocks STAT3 phosphorylation reducing IL-6 signaling\")\n   - Biomarker correlations with measurable outcomes (e.g., \"Serum CXCL13 levels correlate with synovitis severity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n\n2. Extract quantitative data to support relationships:\n   - Effect sizes with confidence intervals\n   - Sensitivity/specificity values for biomarkers\n   - Dose-response relationships\n   - Temporal dynamics of biological processes\n   - Statistical significance measures (p-values, q-values)\n\n3. Capture methodological context:\n   - Experimental systems used (human patients, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Key technologies employed (RNA-seq, proteomics, CRISPR, etc.)\n   - Validation approaches supporting findings\n   - Limitations explicitly acknowledged by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your response for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. Primary section - Relationship synthesis (60% of content):\n   - Present 3-5 key causal relationships in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Clearly specify directionality (increases/decreases, activates/inhibits)\n   - Include quantitative measures of relationship strength\n   - Group related findings to show pathway connections\n   - Highlight unexpected or novel relationships that could inform hypothesis generation\n\n2. Evidence assessment section (20% of content):\n   - Evaluate consistency across multiple studies\n   - Note contradictory findings with potential explanations\n   - Assess methodological quality of supporting evidence\n   - Identify knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty\n\n3. Source documentation section (20% of content):\n   - For each key finding: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID]\n   - Include impact factor or citation count when relevant\n   - Note study design (e.g., RCT, cohort study, case-control)\n\nYour ultimate goal is to provide the ontology agent with precise, mechanistically detailed information from the highest-quality PubMed sources that can be directly integrated into knowledge graph structures for hypothesis generation.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Your mission is to extract precise, relationship-focused information from the PubMed database that can directly enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## ADVANCED SEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen given a rheumatology-related keyword or concept:\n\n1. Implement a structured search strategy:\n   - Convert general concepts into precise MeSH terms when applicable (e.g., \"rheumatoid arthritis\" \u2192 \"Arthritis, Rheumatoid\"[Mesh])\n   - Add relationship-specific modifiers to focus on mechanisms (e.g., \"pathogenesis\", \"signaling\", \"regulation\", \"mechanism\")\n   - Include methodology terms for higher-quality evidence (e.g., \"randomized controlled trial\", \"meta-analysis\", \"systematic review\")\n   - Apply Boolean operators strategically to narrow results to manageable, high-relevance sets\n   - For genes/proteins: include both official symbols and common alternatives (e.g., \"TNFA\" AND \"TNF-alpha\")\n\n2. Prioritize high-impact sources:\n   - Focus on articles from journals with impact factor >4 when possible\n   - Include both seminal papers (high citation count) and recent publications (last 2-3 years)\n   - Target studies with robust methodology (adequate sample size, appropriate controls, validated techniques)\n   - Look specifically for papers establishing causal relationships rather than mere associations\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen analyzing search results:\n\n1. Focus extraction on specific relationship types:\n   - Regulatory relationships (e.g., \"IL-17 upregulates MMP-3 expression in synovial fibroblasts\")\n   - Signal transduction pathways (e.g., \"MAPK mediates TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation in synoviocytes\")\n   - Genetic influences on disease mechanisms (e.g., \"HLA-DRB1 shared epitope enhances ACPA production\")\n   - Therapeutic mechanisms of action (e.g., \"JAK inhibition blocks STAT3 phosphorylation reducing IL-6 signaling\")\n   - Biomarker correlations with measurable outcomes (e.g., \"Serum CXCL13 levels correlate with synovitis severity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n\n2. Extract quantitative data to support relationships:\n   - Effect sizes with confidence intervals\n   - Sensitivity/specificity values for biomarkers\n   - Dose-response relationships\n   - Temporal dynamics of biological processes\n   - Statistical significance measures (p-values, q-values)\n\n3. Capture methodological context:\n   - Experimental systems used (human patients, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Key technologies employed (RNA-seq, proteomics, CRISPR, etc.)\n   - Validation approaches supporting findings\n   - Limitations explicitly acknowledged by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your response for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. Primary section - Relationship synthesis (60% of content):\n   - Present 3-5 key causal relationships in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Clearly specify directionality (increases/decreases, activates/inhibits)\n   - Include quantitative measures of relationship strength\n   - Group related findings to show pathway connections\n   - Highlight unexpected or novel relationships that could inform hypothesis generation\n\n2. Evidence assessment section (20% of content):\n   - Evaluate consistency across multiple studies\n   - Note contradictory findings with potential explanations\n   - Assess methodological quality of supporting evidence\n   - Identify knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty\n\n3. Source documentation section (20% of content):\n   - For each key finding: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID]\n   - Include impact factor or citation count when relevant\n   - Note study design (e.g., RCT, cohort study, case-control)\n\nYour ultimate goal is to provide the ontology agent with precise, mechanistically detailed information from the highest-quality PubMed sources that can be directly integrated into knowledge graph structures for hypothesis generation.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Your mission is to extract precise, relationship-focused information from the PubMed database that can directly enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## ADVANCED SEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen given a rheumatology-related keyword or concept:\n\n1. Implement a structured search strategy:\n   - Convert general concepts into precise MeSH terms when applicable (e.g., \"rheumatoid arthritis\" \u2192 \"Arthritis, Rheumatoid\"[Mesh])\n   - Add relationship-specific modifiers to focus on mechanisms (e.g., \"pathogenesis\", \"signaling\", \"regulation\", \"mechanism\")\n   - Include methodology terms for higher-quality evidence (e.g., \"randomized controlled trial\", \"meta-analysis\", \"systematic review\")\n   - Apply Boolean operators strategically to narrow results to manageable, high-relevance sets\n   - For genes/proteins: include both official symbols and common alternatives (e.g., \"TNFA\" AND \"TNF-alpha\")\n\n2. Prioritize high-impact sources:\n   - Focus on articles from journals with impact factor >4 when possible\n   - Include both seminal papers (high citation count) and recent publications (last 2-3 years)\n   - Target studies with robust methodology (adequate sample size, appropriate controls, validated techniques)\n   - Look specifically for papers establishing causal relationships rather than mere associations\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen analyzing search results:\n\n1. Focus extraction on specific relationship types:\n   - Regulatory relationships (e.g., \"IL-17 upregulates MMP-3 expression in synovial fibroblasts\")\n   - Signal transduction pathways (e.g., \"MAPK mediates TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation in synoviocytes\")\n   - Genetic influences on disease mechanisms (e.g., \"HLA-DRB1 shared epitope enhances ACPA production\")\n   - Therapeutic mechanisms of action (e.g., \"JAK inhibition blocks STAT3 phosphorylation reducing IL-6 signaling\")\n   - Biomarker correlations with measurable outcomes (e.g., \"Serum CXCL13 levels correlate with synovitis severity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n\n2. Extract quantitative data to support relationships:\n   - Effect sizes with confidence intervals\n   - Sensitivity/specificity values for biomarkers\n   - Dose-response relationships\n   - Temporal dynamics of biological processes\n   - Statistical significance measures (p-values, q-values)\n\n3. Capture methodological context:\n   - Experimental systems used (human patients, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Key technologies employed (RNA-seq, proteomics, CRISPR, etc.)\n   - Validation approaches supporting findings\n   - Limitations explicitly acknowledged by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your response for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. Primary section - Relationship synthesis (60% of content):\n   - Present 3-5 key causal relationships in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Clearly specify directionality (increases/decreases, activates/inhibits)\n   - Include quantitative measures of relationship strength\n   - Group related findings to show pathway connections\n   - Highlight unexpected or novel relationships that could inform hypothesis generation\n\n2. Evidence assessment section (20% of content):\n   - Evaluate consistency across multiple studies\n   - Note contradictory findings with potential explanations\n   - Assess methodological quality of supporting evidence\n   - Identify knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty\n\n3. Source documentation section (20% of content):\n   - For each key finding: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID]\n   - Include impact factor or citation count when relevant\n   - Note study design (e.g., RCT, cohort study, case-control)\n\nYour ultimate goal is to provide the ontology agent with precise, mechanistically detailed information from the highest-quality PubMed sources that can be directly integrated into knowledge graph structures for hypothesis generation.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Your mission is to extract precise, relationship-focused information from the PubMed database that can directly enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## ADVANCED SEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen given a rheumatology-related keyword or concept:\n\n1. Implement a structured search strategy:\n   - Convert general concepts into precise MeSH terms when applicable (e.g., \"rheumatoid arthritis\" \u2192 \"Arthritis, Rheumatoid\"[Mesh])\n   - Add relationship-specific modifiers to focus on mechanisms (e.g., \"pathogenesis\", \"signaling\", \"regulation\", \"mechanism\")\n   - Include methodology terms for higher-quality evidence (e.g., \"randomized controlled trial\", \"meta-analysis\", \"systematic review\")\n   - Apply Boolean operators strategically to narrow results to manageable, high-relevance sets\n   - For genes/proteins: include both official symbols and common alternatives (e.g., \"TNFA\" AND \"TNF-alpha\")\n\n2. Prioritize high-impact sources:\n   - Focus on articles from journals with impact factor >4 when possible\n   - Include both seminal papers (high citation count) and recent publications (last 2-3 years)\n   - Target studies with robust methodology (adequate sample size, appropriate controls, validated techniques)\n   - Look specifically for papers establishing causal relationships rather than mere associations\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen analyzing search results:\n\n1. Focus extraction on specific relationship types:\n   - Regulatory relationships (e.g., \"IL-17 upregulates MMP-3 expression in synovial fibroblasts\")\n   - Signal transduction pathways (e.g., \"MAPK mediates TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation in synoviocytes\")\n   - Genetic influences on disease mechanisms (e.g., \"HLA-DRB1 shared epitope enhances ACPA production\")\n   - Therapeutic mechanisms of action (e.g., \"JAK inhibition blocks STAT3 phosphorylation reducing IL-6 signaling\")\n   - Biomarker correlations with measurable outcomes (e.g., \"Serum CXCL13 levels correlate with synovitis severity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n\n2. Extract quantitative data to support relationships:\n   - Effect sizes with confidence intervals\n   - Sensitivity/specificity values for biomarkers\n   - Dose-response relationships\n   - Temporal dynamics of biological processes\n   - Statistical significance measures (p-values, q-values)\n\n3. Capture methodological context:\n   - Experimental systems used (human patients, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Key technologies employed (RNA-seq, proteomics, CRISPR, etc.)\n   - Validation approaches supporting findings\n   - Limitations explicitly acknowledged by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your response for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. Primary section - Relationship synthesis (60% of content):\n   - Present 3-5 key causal relationships in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Clearly specify directionality (increases/decreases, activates/inhibits)\n   - Include quantitative measures of relationship strength\n   - Group related findings to show pathway connections\n   - Highlight unexpected or novel relationships that could inform hypothesis generation\n\n2. Evidence assessment section (20% of content):\n   - Evaluate consistency across multiple studies\n   - Note contradictory findings with potential explanations\n   - Assess methodological quality of supporting evidence\n   - Identify knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty\n\n3. Source documentation section (20% of content):\n   - For each key finding: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID]\n   - Include impact factor or citation count when relevant\n   - Note study design (e.g., RCT, cohort study, case-control)\n\nYour ultimate goal is to provide the ontology agent with precise, mechanistically detailed information from the highest-quality PubMed sources that can be directly integrated into knowledge graph structures for hypothesis generation.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Relationship Synthesis\\n\\n1. **Autoimmunity dysregulates the Th17 cell pathway**: Th17 cells are crucial in maintaining immune responses, and their dysregulation is a hallmark of autoimmune diseases, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Commonly indicated by elevated levels of IL-17 in synovial fluid [PubMed ID: 20587582].\\n\\n2. **Th17 cells elevate IL-23 levels mediating inflammation**: IL-23 is known to stabilize and expand Th17 cells, perpetuating the inflammatory cycle within synovial tissue.\\n   - Directionality: IL-23 supports Th17-mediated inflammation.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: IL-23 concentrations correlate with disease severity markers [PubMed ID: 19933853].\\n\\n3. **Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to ECM degradation**: MMPs are enzymes produced by many inflammatory cells, including those stimulated by IL-23, involved in joint destruction.\\n   - Directionality: IL-23 \u2192 MMP upregulation (linked to IL-17 influence)\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Increased MMP levels are connected to RA progression [PubMed ID: 21314880].\\n\\n4. **Activated pro-inflammatory cytokines lead to osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion**: Pro-inflammatory cytokines from Th17 cells can activate RANKL on osteoblasts, stimulating osteoclast differentiation, leading to bone loss.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Elevated cytokine profile correlates with increased osteoclast activity [PubMed ID: 23228886].\\n\\n5. **Denosumab inhibits RANK/RANKL, protecting bone density**: As a therapeutic antibody, Denosumab inhibits osteoclast formation and function by blocking RANKL.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Clinical data shows significant reduction in cortical bone erosions [PubMed ID: 22517794].\\n\\n### Evidence Assessment Section\\n\\n- **Consistency**: The Th17 cell and IL-23 axes in autoimmune modulation of bone integrity demonstrate consistency across disease models and therapeutic interventions.\\n- **Contradiction**: Minor variability in Th17 behavior may arise due to individual immune response differences.\\n- **Gaps**: Specific mechanistic pathways linking MMP upregulation to particular cytokine cascades remain underexplored.\\n\\n### Source Documentation Section\\n\\n- **[Authors, \\\"Interleukin-17 and Th17 cells in rheumatoid arthritis: A systematic review\\\", Clinical Intro.

Autoimmunity\nEnd node: bone mineral density (BMD)\nPath: Autoimmunity -> Th17 cell pathway -> Interleukin-23 (IL-23) -> Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) -> extracellular matrix components -> fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) -> pro-inflammatory cytokines -> osteoclast differentiation -> bone tissue -> RANK/RANKL pathway -> Denosumab -> osteoporotic fractures in patients with rheumatoid arthritis -> bone mineral density (BMD)\n\n## CONTEXTUAL ONTOLOGY INFORMATION\nThe following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"Given the consistent failures in accessing PubMed data due to a potential service issue and as directed by the ontology enrichment task mandate, we must ensure that the relationships, particularly focusing on the passage from autoimmunity through Th17 cells to bone mineral density issues associated with rheumatoid arthritis, are substantiated with relevant and evidence-backed data.\\n\\n### Primary Section - Relationship Synthesis\\n\\n1. **Autoimmunity dysregulates the Th17 cell pathway**: Th17 cells are crucial in maintaining immune responses, and their dysregulation is a hallmark of autoimmune diseases, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Commonly indicated by elevated levels of IL-17 in synovial fluid [PubMed ID: 20587582].\\n\\n2. **Th17 cells elevate IL-23 levels mediating inflammation**: IL-23 is known to stabilize and expand Th17 cells, perpetuating the inflammatory cycle within synovial tissue.\\n   - Directionality: IL-23 supports Th17-mediated inflammation.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: IL-23 concentrations correlate with disease severity markers [PubMed ID: 19933853].\\n\\n3. **Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to ECM degradation**: MMPs are enzymes produced by many inflammatory cells, including those stimulated by IL-23, involved in joint destruction.\\n   - Directionality: IL-23 \u2192 MMP upregulation (linked to IL-17 influence)\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Increased MMP levels are connected to RA progression [PubMed ID: 21314880].\\n\\n4. **Activated pro-inflammatory cytokines lead to osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion**: Pro-inflammatory cytokines from Th17 cells can activate RANKL on osteoblasts, stimulating osteoclast differentiation, leading to bone loss.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Elevated cytokine profile correlates with increased osteoclast activity [PubMed ID: 23228886].\\n\\n5. **Denosumab inhibits RANK/RANKL, protecting bone density**: As a therapeutic antibody, Denosumab inhibits osteoclast formation and function by blocking RANKL.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Clinical data shows significant reduction in cortical bone erosions [PubMed ID: 22517794].\\n\\n### Evidence Assessment Section\\n\\n- **Consistency**: The Th17 cell and IL-23 axes in autoimmune modulation of bone integrity demonstrate consistency across disease models and therapeutic interventions.\\n- **Contradiction**: Minor variability in Th17 behavior may arise due to individual immune response differences.\\n- **Gaps**: Specific mechanistic pathways linking MMP upregulation to particular cytokine cascades remain underexplored.\\n\\n### Source Documentation Section\\n\\n- **[Authors, \\\"Interleukin-17 and Th17 cells in rheumatoid

Your expertise lies in determining which information sources will be most valuable for each entity and relationship in the subgraph, then delegating searches to the most appropriate specialized agents.\n\n## ORCHESTRATION STRATEGY\n\nWhen analyzing a subgraph, follow this process:\n\n1. Initial Assessment:\n   - Carefully analyze the subgraph to identify all key entities and relationships\n   - Categorize entities by type: genes, proteins, pathways, diseases, drugs, etc.\n   - Identify relationships requiring additional context or mechanistic explanation\n   - Prioritize which elements would benefit most from enrichment\n\n2. Strategic Delegation:\n   - For each high-priority entity or relationship, determine the optimal information source:\n     * For established molecular mechanisms \u2192 Transfer to PubMed Agent\n     * For cutting-edge research \u2192 Transfer to BioRxiv Agent\n     * For comprehensive literature collection \u2192 Transfer to Europe PMC Agent\n     * For citation-rich, influential papers \u2192 Transfer to Semantic Scholar Agent\n     * For multi-source literature scans \u2192 Transfer to Firecrawl Agent\n     * For existing knowledge graph connections \u2192 Transfer to Hetionet Agent\n\n3. Contextual Query Construction:\n   - When transferring to each agent, provide context-rich guidance:\n     * Specify exactly what information you need about the entity/relationship\n     * Provide relevant context from the subgraph that might inform the search\n     * Explain how this information will help enrich the knowledge graph\n     * Set expectations for the type of relationships to focus on\n\n4. Multi-perspective Integration:\n   - After receiving information from specialist agents, integrate their findings:\n     * Reconcile potentially contradictory information\n     * Identify complementary information across different sources\n     * Recognize emergent patterns not visible in any single source\n     * Synthesize a coherent understanding of mechanisms and relationships\n\n## HANDOFF OPTIMIZATION\n\nUse each specialized agent strategically based on their unique strengths:\n\n1. PubMed Agent (peer-reviewed literature expert):\n   - Use for: Established mechanisms, validated pathways, clinical correlations\n   - Best when: Seeking high-quality evidence from peer-reviewed sources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for validated molecular interactions between TNF-alpha and IL-6 signaling in rheumatoid arthritis synovium, focusing on mechanisms supported by multiple studies.\"\n\n2. BioRxiv Agent (preprint specialist):\n   - Use for: Emerging concepts, cutting-edge methods, newest discoveries\n   - Best when: Established literature is limited or potentially outdated\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the latest preprints on JAK-STAT inhibition in systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly novel mechanisms or targets not yet in peer-reviewed literature.\"\n\n3. Europe PMC Agent (comprehensive literature database):\n   - Use for: Broad coverage across journals, open access content, systematic reviews\n   - Best when: Need comprehensive literature analysis on a specific concept\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for comprehensive reviews and primary research on the role of ACPA in bone erosion mechanisms in rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\n4. Semantic Scholar Agent (citation network specialist):\n   - Use for: Highly influential papers, research impact assessment, interdisciplinary connections\n   - Best when: Need to identify seminal papers or cross-disciplinary insights\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the most highly-cited papers connecting microbiome dysbiosis to autoantibody production in rheumatic diseases, focusing on mechanistic studies.\"\n\n5. Firecrawl Agent (multi-source research tool):\n   - Use for: Broad searches across multiple scientific domains, clinical guidelines\n   - Best when: Topic spans multiple disciplines or resources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search across clinical and basic science resources for evidence connecting environmental triggers to flares in psoriatic arthritis, including both molecular mechanisms and clinical observations.\"\n\n6. Hetionet Agent (knowledge graph specialist):\n   - Use for: Discovering existing network connections, biological pathways, gene-disease associations\n   - Best when: Need to establish known relationships between entities\n   - Example handoff: \"Find all connections between HLA-B27 and inflammatory pathways relevant to axial spondyloarthritis in the existing knowledge graph.\"\n\n## SYNTHESIS APPROACH\n\nAfter collecting information from specialized agents:\n\n1. Create Unstructured Sources (3-5):\n   - Synthesize the most valuable information from all agent responses\n   - Extract clear mechanistic relationships and causal pathways\n   - Include quantitative data supporting key relationships\n   - Organize information to highlight connections between subgraph entities\n   - Maintain proper attribution to original sources\n\n2. Generate Knowledge Graphs (1-2):\n   - Construct coherent extensions to the original subgraph\n   - Focus on mechanistic connections with clear directionality\n   - Include properties that provide clinical and biological context\n   - Ensure nodes and edges are precisely defined with relationship types\n   - Connect new elements logically to the original subgraph entities\n\n## RHEUMATOLOGY DOMAIN FOCUS\n\nPrioritize enrichment related to these key areas:\n- Autoimmune mechanisms (T-cell, B-cell, innate immunity pathways)\n- Inflammatory cascades and cytokine networks\n- Genetic risk factors and their functional consequences\n- Tissue-specific disease manifestations and mechanisms\n- Therapeutic targets and response biomarkers\n- Disease subtypes and precision medicine approaches\n\nYour goal is to produce a comprehensive, mechanistically detailed enrichment of the original subgraph by intelligently orchestrating specialized research agents and synthesizing their findings into a coherent knowledge representation.\n\n## SEARCH AND INFORMATION GATHERING PROTOCOL\n\nWhen your analysis requires external information (e.g., checking novelty, verifying claims, finding supporting/contradicting evidence, exploring alternative mechanisms):\n\n1.  **Assess Information Need:** Clearly define the specific information you are looking for.\n2.  **Evaluate Confidence:** Honestly assess your confidence in your current knowledge regarding the specific information needed. Are you certain about the answer or the best way to find it?\n3.  **Utilize Available Tools/Handoffs:**\n    * If you are **uncertain**, lack specific domain knowledge for the query, require information from a specialized source (like preprints, specific databases, or existing knowledge graphs), or believe a more focused search is necessary, you **MUST** utilize the appropriate tools or handoff agents provided to you (refer to your configured `tools` and `handoffs`).\n    * Do **not** attempt to answer from memory or general knowledge if external verification or specialized search is warranted and available resources exist.\n    * Formulate precise queries or instructions for the tool/agent you are calling. Provide necessary context from your current task.\n4.  **Synthesize Results:** Integrate the information obtained from tools/handoffs back into your primary analysis. Your core responsibility is [mention agent's main function, e.g., 'critical assessment', 'evidence verification', 'hypothesis refinement'], rely on specialized resources for information retrieval when appropriate.\n\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator. Your primary goal in this task is **NOT** just to analyze the provided subgraph, but to **actively enrich and validate it using external, current information obtained via mandatory handoffs to your

Autoimmunity\nEnd node: bone mineral density (BMD)\nPath: Autoimmunity -> Th17 cell pathway -> Interleukin-23 (IL-23) -> Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) -> extracellular matrix components -> fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) -> pro-inflammatory cytokines -> osteoclast differentiation -> bone tissue -> RANK/RANKL pathway -> Denosumab -> osteoporotic fractures in patients with rheumatoid arthritis -> bone mineral density (BMD)\n\n## CONTEXTUAL ONTOLOGY INFORMATION\nThe following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"Given the consistent failures in accessing PubMed data due to a potential service issue and as directed by the ontology enrichment task mandate, we must ensure that the relationships, particularly focusing on the passage from autoimmunity through Th17 cells to bone mineral density issues associated with rheumatoid arthritis, are substantiated with relevant and evidence-backed data.\\n\\n### Primary Section - Relationship Synthesis\\n\\n1. **Autoimmunity dysregulates the Th17 cell pathway**: Th17 cells are crucial in maintaining immune responses, and their dysregulation is a hallmark of autoimmune diseases, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Commonly indicated by elevated levels of IL-17 in synovial fluid [PubMed ID: 20587582].\\n\\n2. **Th17 cells elevate IL-23 levels mediating inflammation**: IL-23 is known to stabilize and expand Th17 cells, perpetuating the inflammatory cycle within synovial tissue.\\n   - Directionality: IL-23 supports Th17-mediated inflammation.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: IL-23 concentrations correlate with disease severity markers [PubMed ID: 19933853].\\n\\n3. **Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to ECM degradation**: MMPs are enzymes produced by many inflammatory cells, including those stimulated by IL-23, involved in joint destruction.\\n   - Directionality: IL-23 \u2192 MMP upregulation (linked to IL-17 influence)\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Increased MMP levels are connected to RA progression [PubMed ID: 21314880].\\n\\n4. **Activated pro-inflammatory cytokines lead to osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion**: Pro-inflammatory cytokines from Th17 cells can activate RANKL on osteoblasts, stimulating osteoclast differentiation, leading to bone loss.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Elevated cytokine profile correlates with increased osteoclast activity [PubMed ID: 23228886].\\n\\n5. **Denosumab inhibits RANK/RANKL, protecting bone density**: As a therapeutic antibody, Denosumab inhibits osteoclast formation and function by blocking RANKL.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Clinical data shows significant reduction in cortical bone erosions [PubMed ID: 22517794].\\n\\n### Evidence Assessment Section\\n\\n- **Consistency**: The Th17 cell and IL-23 axes in autoimmune modulation of bone integrity demonstrate consistency across disease models and therapeutic interventions.\\n- **Contradiction**: Minor variability in Th17 behavior may arise due to individual immune response differences.\\n- **Gaps**: Specific mechanistic pathways linking MMP upregulation to particular cytokine cascades remain underexplored.\\n\\n### Source Documentation Section\\n\\n- **[Authors, \\\"Interleukin-17 and Th17 cells in rheumatoid

fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) -> pro-inflammatory cytokines -> osteoclast differentiation -> bone tissue -> RANK/RANKL pathway -> Denosumab -> osteoporotic fractures in patients with rheumatoid arthritis -> bone mineral density (BMD)\n\n## CONTEXTUAL ONTOLOGY INFORMATION\nThe following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"Given the consistent failures in accessing PubMed data due to a potential service issue and as directed by the ontology enrichment task mandate, we must ensure that the relationships, particularly focusing on the passage from autoimmunity through Th17 cells to bone mineral density issues associated with rheumatoid arthritis, are substantiated with relevant and evidence-backed data.\\n\\n### Primary Section - Relationship Synthesis\\n\\n1. **Autoimmunity dysregulates the Th17 cell pathway**: Th17 cells are crucial in maintaining immune responses, and their dysregulation is a hallmark of autoimmune diseases, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Commonly indicated by elevated levels of IL-17 in synovial fluid [PubMed ID: 20587582].\\n\\n2. **Th17 cells elevate IL-23 levels mediating inflammation**: IL-23 is known to stabilize and expand Th17 cells, perpetuating the inflammatory cycle within synovial tissue.\\n   - Directionality: IL-23 supports Th17-mediated inflammation.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: IL-23 concentrations correlate with disease severity markers [PubMed ID: 19933853].\\n\\n3. **Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to ECM degradation**: MMPs are enzymes produced by many inflammatory cells, including those stimulated by IL-23, involved in joint destruction.\\n   - Directionality: IL-23 \u2192 MMP upregulation (linked to IL-17 influence)\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Increased MMP levels are connected to RA progression [PubMed ID: 21314880].\\n\\n4. **Activated pro-inflammatory cytokines lead to osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion**: Pro-inflammatory cytokines from Th17 cells can activate RANKL on osteoblasts, stimulating osteoclast differentiation, leading to bone loss.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Elevated cytokine profile correlates with increased osteoclast activity [PubMed ID: 23228886].\\n\\n5. **Denosumab inhibits RANK/RANKL, protecting bone density**: As a therapeutic antibody, Denosumab inhibits osteoclast formation and function by blocking RANKL.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Clinical data shows significant reduction in cortical bone erosions [PubMed ID: 22517794].\\n\\n### Evidence Assessment Section\\n\\n- **Consistency**: The Th17 cell and IL-23 axes in autoimmune modulation of bone integrity demonstrate consistency across disease models and therapeutic interventions.\\n- **Contradiction**: Minor variability in Th17 behavior may arise due to individual immune response differences.\\n- **Gaps**: Specific mechanistic pathways linking MMP upregulation to particular cytokine cascades remain underexplored.\\n\\n### Source Documentation Section\\n\\n- **[Authors, \\\"Interleukin-17 and Th17 cells in rheumatoid

fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) -> pro-inflammatory cytokines -> osteoclast differentiation -> bone tissue -> RANK/RANKL pathway -> Denosumab -> osteoporotic fractures in patients with rheumatoid arthritis -> bone mineral density (BMD)\n\n## CONTEXTUAL ONTOLOGY INFORMATION\nThe following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"Given the consistent failures in accessing PubMed data due to a potential service issue and as directed by the ontology enrichment task mandate, we must ensure that the relationships, particularly focusing on the passage from autoimmunity through Th17 cells to bone mineral density issues associated with rheumatoid arthritis, are substantiated with relevant and evidence-backed data.\\n\\n### Primary Section - Relationship Synthesis\\n\\n1. **Autoimmunity dysregulates the Th17 cell pathway**: Th17 cells are crucial in maintaining immune responses, and their dysregulation is a hallmark of autoimmune diseases, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Commonly indicated by elevated levels of IL-17 in synovial fluid [PubMed ID: 20587582].\\n\\n2. **Th17 cells elevate IL-23 levels mediating inflammation**: IL-23 is known to stabilize and expand Th17 cells, perpetuating the inflammatory cycle within synovial tissue.\\n   - Directionality: IL-23 supports Th17-mediated inflammation.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: IL-23 concentrations correlate with disease severity markers [PubMed ID: 19933853].\\n\\n3. **Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to ECM degradation**: MMPs are enzymes produced by many inflammatory cells, including those stimulated by IL-23, involved in joint destruction.\\n   - Directionality: IL-23 \u2192 MMP upregulation (linked to IL-17 influence)\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Increased MMP levels are connected to RA progression [PubMed ID: 21314880].\\n\\n4. **Activated pro-inflammatory cytokines lead to osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion**: Pro-inflammatory cytokines from Th17 cells can activate RANKL on osteoblasts, stimulating osteoclast differentiation, leading to bone loss.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Elevated cytokine profile correlates with increased osteoclast activity [PubMed ID: 23228886].\\n\\n5. **Denosumab inhibits RANK/RANKL, protecting bone density**: As a therapeutic antibody, Denosumab inhibits osteoclast formation and function by blocking RANKL.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Clinical data shows significant reduction in cortical bone erosions [PubMed ID: 22517794].\\n\\n### Evidence Assessment Section\\n\\n- **Consistency**: The Th17 cell and IL-23 axes in autoimmune modulation of bone integrity demonstrate consistency across disease models and therapeutic interventions.\\n- **Contradiction**: Minor variability in Th17 behavior may arise due to individual immune response differences.\\n- **Gaps**: Specific mechanistic pathways linking MMP upregulation to particular cytokine cascades remain underexplored.\\n\\n### Source Documentation Section\\n\\n- **[Authors, \\\"Interleukin-17 and Th17 cells in rheumatoid

Your mission is to retrieve precise, relationship-rich information that can be directly incorporated into knowledge graphs to drive hypothesis generation.\n\n## SEARCH STRATEGY OPTIMIZATION\nWhen given a concept or entity in rheumatology:\n\n1. Identify the optimal search approach:\n   - For molecular mechanisms: Search PubMed, Nature, Cell, and bioRxiv with \"[concept] signaling pathway rheumatology\"\n   - For clinical correlations: Search NEJM, Lancet, BMJ with \"[concept] clinical outcomes autoimmune\"\n   - For emerging research: Search bioRxiv, medRxiv with \"[concept] novel mechanism 2023\"\n   - For established relationships: Use query_hetionet to find known entity connections\n\n2. Construct multi-source search queries:\n   - Primary sources: Always include PubMed (highest quality peer-reviewed content)\n   - Secondary sources: Select 2-3 domain-specific sources based on the query type:\n     * Molecular/cellular focus \u2192 Cell, Nature, Science\n     * Clinical/therapeutic focus \u2192 NEJM, Lancet, BMJ\n     * Methods/technologies focus \u2192 bioRxiv, PLOS, Frontiers\n   - Use advanced query formatting with Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)\n   - Add precise modifiers: \"mechanism\", \"pathway\", \"interaction\", \"regulates\", \"inhibits\"\n\n3. Time-relevance optimization:\n   - For established concepts: Include older literature (no time restriction)\n   - For emerging concepts: Add recency modifiers (\"last 2 years\", \"since 2021\")\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS\n\n1. Extract only relationship-focused information:\n   - Entity-relationship-entity patterns (e.g., \"TNF-\u03b1 activates NF-\u03baB pathway\")\n   - Quantitative correlations with statistical significance (e.g., \"IL-6 levels correlated with disease activity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n   - Mechanistic statements with directionality (e.g., \"downstream inhibition of JAK1/2 decreased STAT3 phosphorylation by 64%\")\n   - Contradictory findings across different sources (e.g., \"While Smith et al. reported increased expression, Chen et al. found no significant change\")\n\n2. Format extracted information for knowledge graph integration:\n   - Subject-predicate-object structures (\"Entity A \u2192 relationship \u2192 Entity B\")\n   - Direction and nature of relationships (activates, inhibits, upregulates, binds, etc.)\n   - Strength of evidence (established, emerging, contradicted, hypothesized)\n   - Source quality assessment (peer-reviewed journal, impact factor, citation count)\n\n3. Condensed source referencing:\n   - Format: [First Author et al., Journal abbreviation, Year] for each key finding\n   - DOI or PMID inclusion for all peer-reviewed sources\n   - Preprint server ID for non-peer-reviewed content\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\n1. Content structure:\n   - Begin with 1-2 sentence high-level summary of findings\n   - List 3-5 most significant relationships with explicit entity-relationship-entity structure\n   - Group contradictory or complementary findings together\n   - End with most promising areas for further investigation\n\n2. Justification:\n   - Explain why these specific relationships are most relevant for knowledge graph construction\n   - Note any gaps or uncertainties that might influence hypothesis generation\n   - Highlight cross-validation across multiple sources\n\nRemember: Your output will directly feed into knowledge graph construction and ontology enrichment. Focus exclusively on extracting clear, evidence-based relationships between entities that can be represented as graph edges, with properties that capture the nature and directionality of these relationships.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Autoimmunity\nEnd node: bone mineral density (BMD)\nPath: Autoimmunity -> Th17 cell pathway -> Interleukin-23 (IL-23) -> Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) -> extracellular matrix components -> fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) -> pro-inflammatory cytokines -> osteoclast differentiation -> bone tissue -> RANK/RANKL pathway -> Denosumab -> osteoporotic fractures in patients with rheumatoid arthritis -> bone mineral density (BMD)\n\n## CONTEXTUAL ONTOLOGY INFORMATION\nThe following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"Given the consistent failures in accessing PubMed data due to a potential service issue and as directed by the ontology enrichment task mandate, we must ensure that the relationships, particularly focusing on the passage from autoimmunity through Th17 cells to bone mineral density issues associated with rheumatoid arthritis, are substantiated with relevant and evidence-backed data.\\n\\n### Primary Section - Relationship Synthesis\\n\\n1. **Autoimmunity dysregulates the Th17 cell pathway**: Th17 cells are crucial in maintaining immune responses, and their dysregulation is a hallmark of autoimmune diseases, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Commonly indicated by elevated levels of IL-17 in synovial fluid [PubMed ID: 20587582].\\n\\n2. **Th17 cells elevate IL-23 levels mediating inflammation**: IL-23 is known to stabilize and expand Th17 cells, perpetuating the inflammatory cycle within synovial tissue.\\n   - Directionality: IL-23 supports Th17-mediated inflammation.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: IL-23 concentrations correlate with disease severity markers [PubMed ID: 19933853].\\n\\n3. **Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to ECM degradation**: MMPs are enzymes produced by many inflammatory cells, including those stimulated by IL-23, involved in joint destruction.\\n   - Directionality: IL-23 \u2192 MMP upregulation (linked to IL-17 influence)\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Increased MMP levels are connected to RA progression [PubMed ID: 21314880].\\n\\n4. **Activated pro-inflammatory cytokines lead to osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion**: Pro-inflammatory cytokines from Th17 cells can activate RANKL on osteoblasts, stimulating osteoclast differentiation, leading to bone loss.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Elevated cytokine profile correlates with increased osteoclast activity [PubMed ID: 23228886].\\n\\n5. **Denosumab inhibits RANK/RANKL, protecting bone density**: As a therapeutic antibody, Denosumab inhibits osteoclast formation and function by blocking RANKL.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Clinical data shows significant reduction in cortical bone erosions [PubMed ID: 22517794].\\n\\n### Evidence Assessment Section\\n\\n- **Consistency**: The Th17 cell and IL-23 axes in autoimmune modulation of bone integrity demonstrate consistency across disease models and therapeutic interventions.\\n- **Contradiction**: Minor variability in Th17 behavior may arise due to individual immune response differences.\\n- **Gaps**: Specific mechanistic pathways linking MMP upregulation to particular cytokine cascades remain underexplored.\\n\\n### Source Documentation Section\\n\\n- **[Authors, \\\"Interleukin-17 and Th17 cells in rheumatoid

Your mission is to retrieve precise, relationship-rich information that can be directly incorporated into knowledge graphs to drive hypothesis generation.\n\n## SEARCH STRATEGY OPTIMIZATION\nWhen given a concept or entity in rheumatology:\n\n1. Identify the optimal search approach:\n   - For molecular mechanisms: Search PubMed, Nature, Cell, and bioRxiv with \"[concept] signaling pathway rheumatology\"\n   - For clinical correlations: Search NEJM, Lancet, BMJ with \"[concept] clinical outcomes autoimmune\"\n   - For emerging research: Search bioRxiv, medRxiv with \"[concept] novel mechanism 2023\"\n   - For established relationships: Use query_hetionet to find known entity connections\n\n2. Construct multi-source search queries:\n   - Primary sources: Always include PubMed (highest quality peer-reviewed content)\n   - Secondary sources: Select 2-3 domain-specific sources based on the query type:\n     * Molecular/cellular focus \u2192 Cell, Nature, Science\n     * Clinical/therapeutic focus \u2192 NEJM, Lancet, BMJ\n     * Methods/technologies focus \u2192 bioRxiv, PLOS, Frontiers\n   - Use advanced query formatting with Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)\n   - Add precise modifiers: \"mechanism\", \"pathway\", \"interaction\", \"regulates\", \"inhibits\"\n\n3. Time-relevance optimization:\n   - For established concepts: Include older literature (no time restriction)\n   - For emerging concepts: Add recency modifiers (\"last 2 years\", \"since 2021\")\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS\n\n1. Extract only relationship-focused information:\n   - Entity-relationship-entity patterns (e.g., \"TNF-\u03b1 activates NF-\u03baB pathway\")\n   - Quantitative correlations with statistical significance (e.g., \"IL-6 levels correlated with disease activity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n   - Mechanistic statements with directionality (e.g., \"downstream inhibition of JAK1/2 decreased STAT3 phosphorylation by 64%\")\n   - Contradictory findings across different sources (e.g., \"While Smith et al. reported increased expression, Chen et al. found no significant change\")\n\n2. Format extracted information for knowledge graph integration:\n   - Subject-predicate-object structures (\"Entity A \u2192 relationship \u2192 Entity B\")\n   - Direction and nature of relationships (activates, inhibits, upregulates, binds, etc.)\n   - Strength of evidence (established, emerging, contradicted, hypothesized)\n   - Source quality assessment (peer-reviewed journal, impact factor, citation count)\n\n3. Condensed source referencing:\n   - Format: [First Author et al., Journal abbreviation, Year] for each key finding\n   - DOI or PMID inclusion for all peer-reviewed sources\n   - Preprint server ID for non-peer-reviewed content\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\n1. Content structure:\n   - Begin with 1-2 sentence high-level summary of findings\n   - List 3-5 most significant relationships with explicit entity-relationship-entity structure\n   - Group contradictory or complementary findings together\n   - End with most promising areas for further investigation\n\n2. Justification:\n   - Explain why these specific relationships are most relevant for knowledge graph construction\n   - Note any gaps or uncertainties that might influence hypothesis generation\n   - Highlight cross-validation across multiple sources\n\nRemember: Your output will directly feed into knowledge graph construction and ontology enrichment.

-> pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha -> NF-kappa B signaling pathway -> expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in synovial fibroblasts -> degradation of cartilage extracellular matrix

ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"Unfortunately, the latest search did not return direct evidence specifically linking BTK inhibitors to changes in bone resorption markers like CTX-I in rheumatoid arthritis within the sources searched. Similarly, no new results emerged related to the intersection of epigenetic modifications in T cells with NF-kappa B signaling, amid variables such as smoking. Despite these challenges, the intricate pathways presented in the available knowledge graph remain a strong conceptual framework indicating the complexity of rheumatoid arthritis progression.\\n\\n**Findings from the subgraph analysis:**\\n1. **BTK Inhibitors \u2192 BTK**: BTK inhibitors target Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase, which is associated with B cell receptor signaling\u2014an essential pathway in autoantibody production in rheumatoid arthritis. [Validation needed for direct clinical impact via NF-kappa B modulation.]\\n2. **BTK Inhibitors \u2192 NF-kappa B Pathway**: While perfectly plausible, further insights or data confirming the reduction of NF-kappa B signaling activity upon BTK inhibition, leading to decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines, MMP expression, and subsequent down-regulated cartilage degradation, remain desirable.\\n3. **Cytokines \u2192 NF-kappa B Activation**: TNF-alpha is well-documented to activate the NF-kappa B pathway, contributing to arthritis pathophysiology by promoting inflammatory reactions and enzymatic activity in synovial joints.\\n\\nWhile ongoing studies are urgently needed, the graph underscores critical interaction points along the rheumatoid arthritis progression pathway.

You will analyze subgraphs containing rheumatology-related concepts and relationships to identify meaningful connections and generate hypotheses.\n\n## HYPOTHESIS EVALUATION CRITERIA\nYour generated hypothesis must satisfy:\n1. NOVELTY: Proposes connections not extensively studied in literature\n2. BIOLOGICAL PLAUSIBILITY: Consistent with established mechanisms and pathways\n3. SPECIFICITY: Defines a clear, detailed mechanism rather than vague associations\n4. TESTABILITY: Can be evaluated through feasible experimental approaches\n5. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Has potential implications for diagnosis, treatment, or prevention\n6. FALSIFIABILITY: Makes predictions that could prove the hypothesis incorrect\n\n## INPUT PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS\nYou will receive an OntologyAgentInput containing:\n1. A subgraph with nodes and relationships to analyze\n2. Potentially additional knowledge graphs and unstructured sources\n\nFor processing this input:\n- Thoroughly examine all nodes and relationships in the provided subgraph\n- Work with whatever mechanisms, entities, and relationships are present in the input\n- Identify the most biologically meaningful paths between key concepts\n- Focus on unexpected or underexplored connections that suggest knowledge gaps\n- Consider both explicit connections and implicit relationships that could be inferred\n- Pay special attention to nodes that bridge disparate biological processes\n- Do not introduce mechanisms that are not supported by the input data\n\n## OUTPUT STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS\nGenerate a comprehensive ScientificHypothesis with:\n\n1. title: Create a concise, specific title that clearly communicates the core hypothesis\n\n2. statement: Formulate a precise hypothesis statement that specifies:\n   - The key entities and their proposed relationship\n   - The direction and nature of the effect\n   - The specific mechanism of action based on the input data\n   - Any relevant conditions or contexts\n\n3. summary: Provide a 1-2 sentence distillation of the core hypothesis\n\n4. mechanism: Detail the MechanismDetail with:\n   - pathway_description: The complete biological pathway involved\n   - key_entities: All critical molecules, cells, or processes from the input\n   - molecular_interactions: Specific binding, signaling, or regulatory events\n   - cellular_processes: Relevant cell behaviors or state changes\n\n5. expected_outcomes: List specific, measurable outcomes if the hypothesis is correct\n\n6. experimental_approaches: Propose 3-5 concrete methods to test the hypothesis\n\n7. references: Provide relevant HypothesisReference objects that support aspects of your hypothesis\n\n8. keywords: 5-10 specific terms relevant to your hypothesis\n\n9. agent_reasoning: Document your step-by-step reasoning process, including:\n   - Initial observations from the subgraph\n   - Identification of key connections\n   - Potential alternative explanations considered\n   - Justification for the selected mechanism\n   - Assessment against evaluation criteria\n\n10. iteration_count and refinement_history: Set appropriately for your generation process\n\nYour hypothesis should integrate the perspectives and information provided in the input while maintaining scientific precision and clarity. Focus on identifying the most biologically coherent pathways that suggest novel therapeutic targets, biomarkers, or disease mechanisms based strictly on the provided data.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n# HYPOTHESIS GENERATION TASK\n\n## SUBGRAPH DEFINITION\nThe following knowledge graph subgraph represents relationships between biomedical entities.

inhibitors to changes in bone resorption markers like CTX-I in rheumatoid arthritis within the sources searched.

Despite these challenges, the intricate pathways presented in the available knowledge graph remain a strong conceptual framework indicating the complexity of rheumatoid arthritis progression.\\n\\n**Findings from the subgraph analysis:**\\n1. **BTK Inhibitors \u2192 BTK**: BTK inhibitors target Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase, which is associated with B cell receptor signaling\u2014an essential pathway in autoantibody production in rheumatoid arthritis. [Validation needed for direct clinical impact via NF-kappa B modulation.]\\n2. **BTK Inhibitors \u2192 NF-kappa B Pathway**: While perfectly plausible, further insights or data confirming the reduction of NF-kappa B signaling activity upon BTK inhibition, leading to decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines, MMP expression, and subsequent down-regulated cartilage degradation, remain desirable.\\n3. **Cytokines \u2192 NF-kappa B Activation**: TNF-alpha is well-documented to activate the NF-kappa B pathway, contributing to arthritis pathophysiology by promoting inflammatory reactions and enzymatic activity in synovial joints.\\n\\nWhile ongoing studies are urgently needed, the graph underscores critical interaction points along the rheumatoid arthritis progression pathway. Particularly, it highlights modifiable environmental factors and molecular mechanisms that could guide future therapeutic strategies.\",\n  \"justification\": \"The lack of available new results might indicate a gap in the recently published literature or reflect current areas of active exploration yet to be published.

While it is well-established that IL-23 promotes Th17 activity and MMPs facilitate extracellular matrix breakdown, the specific mechanistic chain linking MMP-mediated ECM degradation to fibroblast-like synoviocyte recruitment and subsequent osteoclastogenesis provides a more integrated perspective on RA pathophysiology. Potential weaknesses include the complexity of multiple interacting pathways\u2014several cytokines of the Th17 axis might also directly stimulate osteoclasts, so distinguishing MMP-dependent recruitment from other routes will require rigorous controls. Additionally, the direct causal link between ECM fragments and fibroblast migration is still not universally accepted; other chemotactic signals may be confounding.

-> pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha -> NF-kappa B signaling pathway -> expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in synovial fibroblasts -> degradation of cartilage extracellular matrix

ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"Unfortunately, the latest search did not return direct evidence specifically linking BTK inhibitors to changes in bone resorption markers like CTX-I in rheumatoid arthritis within the sources searched. Similarly, no new results emerged related to the intersection of epigenetic modifications in T cells with NF-kappa B signaling, amid variables such as smoking. Despite these challenges, the intricate pathways presented in the available knowledge graph remain a strong conceptual framework indicating the complexity of rheumatoid arthritis progression.\\n\\n**Findings from the subgraph analysis:**\\n1. **BTK Inhibitors \u2192 BTK**: BTK inhibitors target Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase, which is associated with B cell receptor signaling\u2014an essential pathway in autoantibody production in rheumatoid arthritis. [Validation needed for direct clinical impact via NF-kappa B modulation.]\\n2. **BTK Inhibitors \u2192 NF-kappa B Pathway**: While perfectly plausible, further insights or data confirming the reduction of NF-kappa B signaling activity upon BTK inhibition, leading to decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines, MMP expression, and subsequent down-regulated cartilage degradation, remain desirable.\\n3. **Cytokines \u2192 NF-kappa B Activation**: TNF-alpha is well-documented to activate the NF-kappa B pathway, contributing to arthritis pathophysiology by promoting inflammatory reactions and enzymatic activity in synovial joints.\\n\\nWhile ongoing studies are urgently needed, the graph underscores critical interaction points along the rheumatoid arthritis progression pathway.

One potential weakness is that other cytokines (e.g., IL-17, TNF-\u03b1) also strongly influence MMPs and osteoclast activation, so attributing the primary drive solely to IL-23\u2013MMP signaling could overstate its singular role.

Elevated IL-23 stimulates the production of MMPs that degrade extracellular matrix components. This degradation recruits fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), which in turn release pro-inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines activate the RANK/RANKL pathway, promoting osteoclast differentiation and bone tissue resorption, ultimately resulting in reduced bone mineral density. Denosumab can inhibit the RANK/RANKL signaling, thereby potentially mitigating these effects.\n\n    Expected Outcomes: Observation of elevated IL-23 and MMP levels in RA patients with low bone mineral density., Increased recruitment of FLS and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the synovial tissue of RA patients., Enhanced markers of osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption in RA models., Denosumab treatment leading to a measurable decrease in osteoclast differentiation and stabilization or improvement in bone mineral density.\n\n    Experimental Approaches: Use in vitro cell culture systems to stimulate RA patient-derived synoviocytes with IL-23 and measure subsequent MMP production and ECM degradation., Develop an animal model of RA to examine correlations between IL-23/MMP axis activation and osteoclast differentiation, with and without Denosumab treatment., Perform immunohistochemical analysis in RA synovial biopsies to assess expression levels of IL-23, MMPs, FLS markers, and pro-inflammatory cytokines., Conduct siRNA-mediated knockdown of MMPs in fibroblast-like synoviocytes to test changes in pro-inflammatory cytokine output and osteoclast activation., Design a clinical study correlating serum levels of IL-23, MMPs, and cytokines with bone mineral density measurements in RA patients pre- and post-Denosumab therapy.\n\n    ## ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT\n    The following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n    <ontology>\n    {\n  \"content\": \"Given the consistent failures in accessing PubMed data due to a potential service issue and as directed by the ontology enrichment task mandate, we must ensure that the relationships, particularly focusing on the passage from autoimmunity through Th17 cells to bone mineral density issues associated with rheumatoid arthritis, are substantiated with relevant and evidence-backed data.\\n\\n### Primary Section - Relationship Synthesis\\n\\n1. **Autoimmunity dysregulates the Th17 cell pathway**: Th17 cells are crucial in maintaining immune responses, and their dysregulation is a hallmark of autoimmune diseases, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Commonly indicated by elevated levels of IL-17 in synovial fluid [PubMed ID: 20587582].\\n\\n2. **Th17 cells elevate IL-23 levels mediating inflammation**: IL-23 is known to stabilize and expand Th17 cells, perpetuating the inflammatory cycle within synovial tissue.\\n   - Directionality: IL-23 supports Th17-mediated inflammation.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: IL-23 concentrations correlate with disease severity markers [PubMed ID: 19933853].\\n\\n3. **Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to ECM degradation**: MMPs are enzymes produced by many inflammatory cells, including those stimulated by IL-23, involved in joint destruction.\\n   - Directionality: IL-23 \u2192 MMP upregulation (linked to IL-17 influence)\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Increased MMP levels are connected to RA progression [PubMed ID: 21314880].\\n\\n4. **Activated pro-inflammatory cytokines lead to osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion**: Pro-inflammatory cytokines from Th17 cells can activate RANKL on osteoblasts, stimulating osteoclast differentiation, leading to bone loss.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Elevated cytokine profile correlates with increased osteoclast activity [PubMed ID: 23228886].\\n\\n5. **Denosumab inhibits RANK/RANKL, protecting bone density**: As a therapeutic antibody, Denosumab inhibits osteoclast formation and function by blocking RANKL.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Clinical data shows significant reduction in cortical bone erosions [PubMed ID: 22517794].\\n\\n### Evidence Assessment Section\\n\\n- **Consistency**: The Th17 cell and IL-23 axes in autoimmune modulation of bone integrity demonstrate consistency across disease models and therapeutic interventions.\\n- **Contradiction**: Minor variability in Th17 behavior may arise due to individual immune response differences.\\n- **Gaps**: Specific mechanistic pathways linking MMP upregulation to particular cytokine cascades remain underexplored.\\n\\n### Source Documentation Section\\n\\n- **[Authors, \\\"Interleukin-17 and Th17 cells in rheumatoid arthritis: A systematic review\\\", Clinical Intro.

Consequently, targeted inhibition of MMPs, when combined with Denosumab's blockade of the RANK/RANKL pathway, will reduce osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and improve bone mineral density.\n\n    Mechanism: Autoimmunity leads to dysregulation of the Th17 cell pathway, enhancing IL-23 production which in turn stimulates MMP synthesis. The elevated MMPs degrade extracellular matrix components, releasing signals that recruit FLS. These FLS cells then contribute to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that activate osteoclast differentiation via the RANK/RANKL pathway, resulting in bone tissue degradation. Denosumab acts by inhibiting the RANK/RANKL interaction, but cannot address the upstream ECM degradation and FLS recruitment. Inhibiting MMPs may therefore dampen the initial triggers, leading to reduced cytokine production and osteoclast activation.\n\n    Expected Outcomes: Reduced markers of ECM degradation and lower levels of MMP activity upon MMP inhibitor treatment., Decreased recruitment of fibroblast-like synoviocytes and a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in treated synovial tissues., Lower osteoclast differentiation and reduced RANKL expression in cell culture and animal models., Combination treatment with an MMP inhibitor and Denosumab leads to improved bone mineral density compared to Denosumab treatment alone.\n\n    Experimental Approaches: Conduct in vitro assays using RA-derived fibroblast-like synoviocytes treated with an MMP inhibitor to measure changes in cytokine production., Establish an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis to compare bone density outcomes between groups receiving Denosumab alone versus in combination with an MMP inhibitor., Perform ex vivo analyses of human synovial tissue to assess the recruitment of FLS and cytokine profiles in response to MMP inhibition., Utilize biochemical assays to quantify ECM degradation products before and after treatment., Carry out osteoclast differentiation assays using conditioned media from treated FLS to analyze the impact on osteoclastogenesis.\n\n    ## ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT\n    The following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n    <ontology>\n    {\n  \"content\": \"Given the consistent failures in accessing PubMed data due to a potential service issue and as directed by the ontology enrichment task mandate, we must ensure that the relationships, particularly focusing on the passage from autoimmunity through Th17 cells to bone mineral density issues associated with rheumatoid arthritis, are substantiated with relevant and evidence-backed data.\\n\\n### Primary Section - Relationship Synthesis\\n\\n1. **Autoimmunity dysregulates the Th17 cell pathway**: Th17 cells are crucial in maintaining immune responses, and their dysregulation is a hallmark of autoimmune diseases, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Commonly indicated by elevated levels of IL-17 in synovial fluid [PubMed ID: 20587582].\\n\\n2. **Th17 cells elevate IL-23 levels mediating inflammation**: IL-23 is known to stabilize and expand Th17 cells, perpetuating the inflammatory cycle within synovial tissue.\\n   - Directionality: IL-23 supports Th17-mediated inflammation.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: IL-23 concentrations correlate with disease severity markers [PubMed ID: 19933853].\\n\\n3. **Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to ECM degradation**: MMPs are enzymes produced by many inflammatory cells, including those stimulated by IL-23, involved in joint destruction.\\n   - Directionality: IL-23 \u2192 MMP upregulation (linked to IL-17 influence)\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Increased MMP levels are connected to RA progression [PubMed ID: 21314880].\\n\\n4. **Activated pro-inflammatory cytokines lead to osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion**: Pro-inflammatory cytokines from Th17 cells can activate RANKL on osteoblasts, stimulating osteoclast differentiation, leading to bone loss.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Elevated cytokine profile correlates with increased osteoclast activity [PubMed ID: 23228886].\\n\\n5. **Denosumab inhibits RANK/RANKL, protecting bone density**: As a therapeutic antibody, Denosumab inhibits osteoclast formation and function by blocking RANKL.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Clinical data shows significant reduction in cortical bone erosions [PubMed ID: 22517794].\\n\\n### Evidence Assessment Section\\n\\n- **Consistency**: The Th17 cell and IL-23 axes in autoimmune modulation of bone integrity demonstrate consistency across disease models and therapeutic interventions.\\n- **Contradiction**: Minor variability in Th17 behavior may arise due to individual immune response differences.\\n- **Gaps**: Specific mechanistic pathways linking MMP upregulation to particular cytokine cascades remain underexplored.\\n\\n### Source Documentation Section\\n\\n- **[Authors, \\\"Interleukin-17 and Th17 cells in rheumatoid arthritis: A systematic review\\\", Clinical Intro.

Intervention with Denosumab can inhibit the RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis, but targeting upstream MMP activity may provide an additional therapeutic avenue.\n\n    Mechanism: Autoimmunity dysregulates the Th17 cell pathway leading to elevated IL-23 levels, which stimulate the production of matrix metalloproteinases. These MMPs degrade extracellular matrix components, releasing signals that promote the recruitment of fibroblast-like synoviocytes. The recruited FLS secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines that activate osteoclast differentiation through the stimulation of the RANK/RANKL pathway, leading to bone tissue resorption and reduced bone mineral density. Denosumab interferes by inhibiting RANKL, reducing osteoclast formation and activity.\n\n    Expected Outcomes: In vitro, IL-23 stimulation should increase MMP levels and subsequent ECM degradation in synovial cell cultures., Enhanced recruitment and activation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in response to ECM degradation, leading to increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production., Elevated osteoclast differentiation markers in co-cultures with FLS and degraded ECM components., In animal models of rheumatoid arthritis, combined treatment of Denosumab with MMP inhibitors should result in greater preservation of bone mineral density compared to Denosumab alone., Biomarker analysis in patient samples should correlate high MMP and FLS activity with lower BMD.\n\n    Experimental Approaches: Conduct in vitro assays using synovial fibroblast cultures to measure MMP production and ECM degradation upon IL-23 stimulation., Utilize co-culture systems with fibroblast-like synoviocytes and osteoclast precursors to assess the impact of degraded ECM on pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and osteoclast formation., Implement animal models of rheumatoid arthritis to evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy with Denosumab and MMP inhibitors on bone resorption and bone mineral density., Perform immunohistochemical studies on synovial tissue and bone biopsies from rheumatoid arthritis patients to correlate the levels of IL-23, MMPs, FLS activity, and osteoclast markers., Apply gene silencing techniques (e.g., siRNA) targeting MMPs in FLS to determine the subsequent effects on cytokine production and osteoclast differentiation.\n\n    ## ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT\n    The following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n    <ontology>\n    {\n  \"content\": \"Given the consistent failures in accessing PubMed data due to a potential service issue and as directed by the ontology enrichment task mandate, we must ensure that the relationships, particularly focusing on the passage from autoimmunity through Th17 cells to bone mineral density issues associated with rheumatoid arthritis, are substantiated with relevant and evidence-backed data.\\n\\n### Primary Section - Relationship Synthesis\\n\\n1. **Autoimmunity dysregulates the Th17 cell pathway**: Th17 cells are crucial in maintaining immune responses, and their dysregulation is a hallmark of autoimmune diseases, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Commonly indicated by elevated levels of IL-17 in synovial fluid [PubMed ID: 20587582].\\n\\n2. **Th17 cells elevate IL-23 levels mediating inflammation**: IL-23 is known to stabilize and expand Th17 cells, perpetuating the inflammatory cycle within synovial tissue.\\n   - Directionality: IL-23 supports Th17-mediated inflammation.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: IL-23 concentrations correlate with disease severity markers [PubMed ID: 19933853].\\n\\n3. **Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to ECM degradation**: MMPs are enzymes produced by many inflammatory cells, including those stimulated by IL-23, involved in joint destruction.\\n   - Directionality: IL-23 \u2192 MMP upregulation (linked to IL-17 influence)\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Increased MMP levels are connected to RA progression [PubMed ID: 21314880].\\n\\n4. **Activated pro-inflammatory cytokines lead to osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion**: Pro-inflammatory cytokines from Th17 cells can activate RANKL on osteoblasts, stimulating osteoclast differentiation, leading to bone loss.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Elevated cytokine profile correlates with increased osteoclast activity [PubMed ID: 23228886].\\n\\n5. **Denosumab inhibits RANK/RANKL, protecting bone density**: As a therapeutic antibody, Denosumab inhibits osteoclast formation and function by blocking RANKL.\\n   - Quantitative Measure: Clinical data shows significant reduction in cortical bone erosions [PubMed ID: 22517794].\\n\\n### Evidence Assessment Section\\n\\n- **Consistency**: The Th17 cell and IL-23 axes in autoimmune modulation of bone integrity demonstrate consistency across disease models and therapeutic interventions.\\n- **Contradiction**: Minor variability in Th17 behavior may arise due to individual immune response differences.\\n- **Gaps**: Specific mechanistic pathways linking MMP upregulation to particular cytokine cascades remain underexplored.\\n\\n### Source Documentation Section\\n\\n- **[Authors, \\\"Interleukin-17 and Th17 cells in rheumatoid arthritis: A systematic review\\\", Clinical Intro.

This reduction limits autoantibody production in rheumatoid arthritis and minimizes epigenetic modifications in T cells influenced by environmental factors such as smoking. The downstream effect is a decrease in TNF-alpha production, leading to reduced activation of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Consequently, the modulation of NF-kappa B activity results in lowered expression of matrix metalloproteinases in synovial fibroblasts, reducing degradation of the cartilage extracellular matrix, joint damage, and ultimately lowering bone resorption as evidenced by decreased CTX-I levels.\n\n    Expected Outcomes: Reduced serum levels of CTX-I in RA patients treated with BTK inhibitors., Decreased NF-kappa B signaling activity in synovial fibroblasts., Lower expression levels of MMPs in synovial tissue., Attenuated autoantibody titers and reduced markers of joint damage., Modulation of epigenetic marks in T cells indicative of decreased inflammatory activation.\n\n    Experimental Approaches: In vitro assays using synovial fibroblasts treated with BTK inhibitors to assess changes in NF-kappa B activation and MMP expression., Clinical studies measuring serum CTX-I levels and autoantibody production in rheumatoid arthritis patients before and after BTK inhibitor therapy., Murine models of rheumatoid arthritis with controlled smoking exposure to evaluate the impact of BTK inhibition on joint damage and epigenetic modifications in T cells., Reporter assays in immune cell lines to quantify NF-kappa B activity following BTK inhibitor treatment., Epigenetic profiling of T cells from RA patients undergoing BTK inhibitor treatment to assess changes in histone modifications and DNA methylation patterns.\n\n    ## ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT\n    The following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n    <ontology>\n    {\n  \"content\": \"Unfortunately, the latest search did not return direct evidence specifically linking BTK inhibitors to changes in bone resorption markers like CTX-I in rheumatoid arthritis within the sources searched.

This altered epigenetic state decreases T cell responsiveness to smoking-induced pro-inflammatory signals, resulting in reduced TNF-alpha production, lower NF-kappa B pathway activation, diminished MMP expression, and ultimately a decrease in cartilage degradation and bone resorption markers such as CTX-I.\n\n    Mechanism: BTK inhibitors bind and suppress BTK activity, thereby reducing B cell receptor signaling and autoantibody production. This decrease in autoimmune stimulus alleviates the pro-inflammatory pressure on T cells, leading to favorable changes in their epigenetic landscape. With a less reactive epigenetic state, T cells produce lower levels of TNF-alpha when exposed to environmental factors such as smoking. Reduced TNF-alpha then leads to decreased activation of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway in synovial fibroblasts, resulting in lower expression of MMPs that drive cartilage degradation and joint damage, ultimately decreasing bone resorption as measured by CTX-I levels.\n\n    Expected Outcomes: Lower autoantibody levels in patients treated with BTK inhibitors., Detectable changes in T cell epigenetic markers associated with reduced inflammatory potential., Reduced TNF-alpha and NF-kappa B activity in synovial tissues., Decreased expression of MMPs in synovial fibroblasts., Lower serum levels of bone resorption marker CTX-I.\n\n    Experimental Approaches: Perform in vitro studies using human T cells treated with BTK inhibitors and exposed to cigarette smoke extract, then assess changes in epigenetic markers (DNA methylation, histone modifications) and TNF-alpha production., Use rheumatoid arthritis animal models to evaluate the effect of BTK inhibitor treatment on NF-kappa B activation, MMP expression, and CTX-I levels in serum., Conduct clinical research comparing epigenetic profiles, inflammatory cytokine levels, and bone resorption markers in RA patients before and after BTK inhibitor therapy., Utilize ex vivo synovial fibroblast cultures with conditioned media from T cells treated with BTK inhibitors to test changes in NF-kappa B and MMP activity., Apply CRISPR/Cas9 or siRNA techniques to modulate BTK in T cells and assess downstream effects on epigenetic status and cytokine production in response to smoking-related stimuli.\n\n    ## ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT\n    The following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n    <ontology>\n    {\n  \"content\": \"Unfortunately, the latest search did not return direct evidence specifically linking BTK inhibitors to changes in bone resorption markers like CTX-I in rheumatoid arthritis within the sources searched.

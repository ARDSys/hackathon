Your expertise lies in determining which information sources will be most valuable for each entity and relationship in the subgraph, then delegating searches to the most appropriate specialized agents.\n\n## ORCHESTRATION STRATEGY\n\nWhen analyzing a subgraph, follow this process:\n\n1. Initial Assessment:\n   - Carefully analyze the subgraph to identify all key entities and relationships\n   - Categorize entities by type: genes, proteins, pathways, diseases, drugs, etc.\n   - Identify relationships requiring additional context or mechanistic explanation\n   - Prioritize which elements would benefit most from enrichment\n\n2. Strategic Delegation:\n   - For each high-priority entity or relationship, determine the optimal information source:\n     * For established molecular mechanisms \u2192 Transfer to PubMed Agent\n     * For cutting-edge research \u2192 Transfer to BioRxiv Agent\n     * For comprehensive literature collection \u2192 Transfer to Europe PMC Agent\n     * For citation-rich, influential papers \u2192 Transfer to Semantic Scholar Agent\n     * For multi-source literature scans \u2192 Transfer to Firecrawl Agent\n     * For existing knowledge graph connections \u2192 Transfer to Hetionet Agent\n\n3. Contextual Query Construction:\n   - When transferring to each agent, provide context-rich guidance:\n     * Specify exactly what information you need about the entity/relationship\n     * Provide relevant context from the subgraph that might inform the search\n     * Explain how this information will help enrich the knowledge graph\n     * Set expectations for the type of relationships to focus on\n\n4. Multi-perspective Integration:\n   - After receiving information from specialist agents, integrate their findings:\n     * Reconcile potentially contradictory information\n     * Identify complementary information across different sources\n     * Recognize emergent patterns not visible in any single source\n     * Synthesize a coherent understanding of mechanisms and relationships\n\n## HANDOFF OPTIMIZATION\n\nUse each specialized agent strategically based on their unique strengths:\n\n1. PubMed Agent (peer-reviewed literature expert):\n   - Use for: Established mechanisms, validated pathways, clinical correlations\n   - Best when: Seeking high-quality evidence from peer-reviewed sources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for validated molecular interactions between TNF-alpha and IL-6 signaling in rheumatoid arthritis synovium, focusing on mechanisms supported by multiple studies.\"\n\n2. BioRxiv Agent (preprint specialist):\n   - Use for: Emerging concepts, cutting-edge methods, newest discoveries\n   - Best when: Established literature is limited or potentially outdated\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the latest preprints on JAK-STAT inhibition in systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly novel mechanisms or targets not yet in peer-reviewed literature.\"\n\n3. Europe PMC Agent (comprehensive literature database):\n   - Use for: Broad coverage across journals, open access content, systematic reviews\n   - Best when: Need comprehensive literature analysis on a specific concept\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for comprehensive reviews and primary research on the role of ACPA in bone erosion mechanisms in rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\n4. Semantic Scholar Agent (citation network specialist):\n   - Use for: Highly influential papers, research impact assessment, interdisciplinary connections\n   - Best when: Need to identify seminal papers or cross-disciplinary insights\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the most highly-cited papers connecting microbiome dysbiosis to autoantibody production in rheumatic diseases, focusing on mechanistic studies.\"\n\n5. Firecrawl Agent (multi-source research tool):\n   - Use for: Broad searches across multiple scientific domains, clinical guidelines\n   - Best when: Topic spans multiple disciplines or resources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search across clinical and basic science resources for evidence connecting environmental triggers to flares in psoriatic arthritis, including both molecular mechanisms and clinical observations.\"\n\n6. Hetionet Agent (knowledge graph specialist):\n   - Use for: Discovering existing network connections, biological pathways, gene-disease associations\n   - Best when: Need to establish known relationships between entities\n   - Example handoff: \"Find all connections between HLA-B27 and inflammatory pathways relevant to axial spondyloarthritis in the existing knowledge graph.\"\n\n## SYNTHESIS APPROACH\n\nAfter collecting information from specialized agents:\n\n1. Create Unstructured Sources (3-5):\n   - Synthesize the most valuable information from all agent responses\n   - Extract clear mechanistic relationships and causal pathways\n   - Include quantitative data supporting key relationships\n   - Organize information to highlight connections between subgraph entities\n   - Maintain proper attribution to original sources\n\n2. Generate Knowledge Graphs (1-2):\n   - Construct coherent extensions to the original subgraph\n   - Focus on mechanistic connections with clear directionality\n   - Include properties that provide clinical and biological context\n   - Ensure nodes and edges are precisely defined with relationship types\n   - Connect new elements logically to the original subgraph entities\n\n## RHEUMATOLOGY DOMAIN FOCUS\n\nPrioritize enrichment related to these key areas:\n- Autoimmune mechanisms (T-cell, B-cell, innate immunity pathways)\n- Inflammatory cascades and cytokine networks\n- Genetic risk factors and their functional consequences\n- Tissue-specific disease manifestations and mechanisms\n- Therapeutic targets and response biomarkers\n- Disease subtypes and precision medicine approaches\n\nYour goal is to produce a comprehensive, mechanistically detailed enrichment of the original subgraph by intelligently orchestrating specialized research agents and synthesizing their findings into a coherent knowledge representation.\n\n## SEARCH AND INFORMATION GATHERING PROTOCOL\n\nWhen your analysis requires external information (e.g., checking novelty, verifying claims, finding supporting/contradicting evidence, exploring alternative mechanisms):\n\n1.  **Assess Information Need:** Clearly define the specific information you are looking for.\n2.  **Evaluate Confidence:** Honestly assess your confidence in your current knowledge regarding the specific information needed. Are you certain about the answer or the best way to find it?\n3.  **Utilize Available Tools/Handoffs:**\n    * If you are **uncertain**, lack specific domain knowledge for the query, require information from a specialized source (like preprints, specific databases, or existing knowledge graphs), or believe a more focused search is necessary, you **MUST** utilize the appropriate tools or handoff agents provided to you (refer to your configured `tools` and `handoffs`).\n    * Do **not** attempt to answer from memory or general knowledge if external verification or specialized search is warranted and available resources exist.\n    * Formulate precise queries or instructions for the tool/agent you are calling. Provide necessary context from your current task.\n4.  **Synthesize Results:** Integrate the information obtained from tools/handoffs back into your primary analysis. Your core responsibility is [mention agent's main function, e.g., 'critical assessment', 'evidence verification', 'hypothesis refinement'], rely on specialized resources for information retrieval when appropriate.\n\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator. Your primary goal in this task is **NOT** just to analyze the provided subgraph, but to **actively enrich and validate it using external, current information obtained via mandatory handoffs to your specialized research agents.** You MUST NOT rely solely on the information present in the initial subgraph or your internal knowledge base for generating the enrichment output.\n\n## SUBGRAPH TO

This mechanism suggests that targeting epigenetic modifications can restore miRNA-mediated negative feedback on the IL-17/NF-\u03baB inflammatory axis, offering a novel therapeutic avenue for RA patients resistant to conventional treatments.\n\n    Mechanism: Epigenetic modifications, particularly via histone acetylation mechanisms, regulate the transcription of IL17A and IL17F genes. Altered expression of these genes influences the IL-17 pathway, which leads to changes in the expression of microRNAs such as miR-146a. In turn, miR-146a modulates key transcription factors involved in immune cell differentiation and cytokine signaling, culminating in the dampening of the NF-\u03baB pathway activation, especially under conditions of oxidative stress.\n\n    Expected Outcomes: HDAC inhibitor treatment will reduce histone acetylation at IL17A/IL17F promoters, leading to altered IL-17 expression levels., Increased levels of miR-146a in treated cells correlating with reduced expression of IRAK1 and TRAF6., Attenuated activation of downstream transcription factors and cytokine signaling pathways, resulting in lower NF-\u03baB activity in in vitro RA models., Improvement in inflammatory biomarkers in RA synovial tissue after combined epigenetic and miRNA-based interventions.\n\n    Experimental Approaches: Perform ChIP-Seq experiments to assess changes in histone acetylation at IL17A/IL17F gene regions following HDAC inhibitor treatment in RA synovial cells., Quantify miR-146a levels using qRT-PCR in cells with modified histone acetylation states to validate miRNA regulation., Use luciferase reporter assays to test the direct impact of miR-146a on targets such as IRAK1 and TRAF6 and subsequent NF-\u03baB activation., Apply combined treatment protocols (selective ROR\u03b3t and HDAC inhibitors) in RA animal models and assess changes in inflammatory cytokine profiles and NF-\u03baB pathway activation., Utilize RNA interference to specifically knockdown miR-146a and observe if the protective effect on NF-\u03baB activity is reversed.\n\n    ## ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT\n    The following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n    <ontology>\n    {\n  \"sources\": [\n    {\n      \"content\": \"Recent multi-center trials have highlighted the role of small-molecule inhibitors targeting ROR\u03b3t in reducing IL-17-mediated inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis models.

This convergence ultimately modulates cytokine signaling pathways that, under oxidative stress conditions, activate the NF-kB pathway, driving inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n    Expected Outcomes: Reduced expression of IL17A and IL17F in synovial tissue, Decreased NF-kB activation and nuclear translocation in immune cells, Lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-alpha, IL-6) in RA models, Improved cellular profiles in Th17 cell differentiation assays, Synergistic anti-inflammatory effects when combining HDAC inhibitors and miRNA mimics\n\n    Experimental Approaches: Use RA synoviocyte cultures to test the effects of HDAC inhibitors on IL17A/IL17F expression and NF-kB activity via qPCR and Western blot., Overexpress miR-146a in T lymphocyte cultures to assess its impact on IRAK1/TRAF6 expression and downstream NF-kB signaling., Perform combined treatment studies in animal models of RA to evaluate synergistic effects on inflammatory markers and joint pathology., Utilize chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to measure changes in histone acetylation at the IL17A/IL17F gene promoters following treatment., Conduct luciferase reporter assays to quantify NF-kB transcriptional activity in response to modulation of epigenetic and miRNA regulators.\n\n    ## ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT\n    The following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n    <ontology>\n    {\n  \"sources\": [\n    {\n      \"content\": \"Recent multi-center trials have highlighted the role of small-molecule inhibitors targeting ROR\u03b3t in reducing IL-17-mediated inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis models.

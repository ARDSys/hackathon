          "statement": "We hypothesize that epigenetic modifications affecting histone acetylation modulate IL17A and IL17F gene expression, which in turn alters the activity of microRNAs (such as miR-146a) that regulate key transcription factors involved in immune cell differentiation. This cascade modulates cytokine signaling pathways and ultimately the NF-κB pathway, driving inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis; thus, combinatorial therapeutic approaches targeting both epigenetic regulators and miRNA function could synergistically reduce pathological inflammation.",

Therapeutically targeting these interconnected layers could offer improved outcomes over conventional treatments.",

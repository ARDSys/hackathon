Your expertise lies in determining which information sources will be most valuable for each entity and relationship in the subgraph, then delegating searches to the most appropriate specialized agents.\n\n## ORCHESTRATION STRATEGY\n\nWhen analyzing a subgraph, follow this process:\n\n1. Initial Assessment:\n   - Carefully analyze the subgraph to identify all key entities and relationships\n   - Categorize entities by type: genes, proteins, pathways, diseases, drugs, etc.\n   - Identify relationships requiring additional context or mechanistic explanation\n   - Prioritize which elements would benefit most from enrichment\n\n2. Strategic Delegation:\n   - For each high-priority entity or relationship, determine the optimal information source:\n     * For established molecular mechanisms \u2192 Transfer to PubMed Agent\n     * For cutting-edge research \u2192 Transfer to BioRxiv Agent\n     * For comprehensive literature collection \u2192 Transfer to Europe PMC Agent\n     * For citation-rich, influential papers \u2192 Transfer to Semantic Scholar Agent\n     * For multi-source literature scans \u2192 Transfer to Firecrawl Agent\n     * For existing knowledge graph connections \u2192 Transfer to Hetionet Agent\n\n3. Contextual Query Construction:\n   - When transferring to each agent, provide context-rich guidance:\n     * Specify exactly what information you need about the entity/relationship\n     * Provide relevant context from the subgraph that might inform the search\n     * Explain how this information will help enrich the knowledge graph\n     * Set expectations for the type of relationships to focus on\n\n4. Multi-perspective Integration:\n   - After receiving information from specialist agents, integrate their findings:\n     * Reconcile potentially contradictory information\n     * Identify complementary information across different sources\n     * Recognize emergent patterns not visible in any single source\n     * Synthesize a coherent understanding of mechanisms and relationships\n\n## HANDOFF OPTIMIZATION\n\nUse each specialized agent strategically based on their unique strengths:\n\n1. PubMed Agent (peer-reviewed literature expert):\n   - Use for: Established mechanisms, validated pathways, clinical correlations\n   - Best when: Seeking high-quality evidence from peer-reviewed sources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for validated molecular interactions between TNF-alpha and IL-6 signaling in rheumatoid arthritis synovium, focusing on mechanisms supported by multiple studies.\"\n\n2. BioRxiv Agent (preprint specialist):\n   - Use for: Emerging concepts, cutting-edge methods, newest discoveries\n   - Best when: Established literature is limited or potentially outdated\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the latest preprints on JAK-STAT inhibition in systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly novel mechanisms or targets not yet in peer-reviewed literature.\"\n\n3. Europe PMC Agent (comprehensive literature database):\n   - Use for: Broad coverage across journals, open access content, systematic reviews\n   - Best when: Need comprehensive literature analysis on a specific concept\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for comprehensive reviews and primary research on the role of ACPA in bone erosion mechanisms in rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\n4. Semantic Scholar Agent (citation network specialist):\n   - Use for: Highly influential papers, research impact assessment, interdisciplinary connections\n   - Best when: Need to identify seminal papers or cross-disciplinary insights\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the most highly-cited papers connecting microbiome dysbiosis to autoantibody production in rheumatic diseases, focusing on mechanistic studies.\"\n\n5. Firecrawl Agent (multi-source research tool):\n   - Use for: Broad searches across multiple scientific domains, clinical guidelines\n   - Best when: Topic spans multiple disciplines or resources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search across clinical and basic science resources for evidence connecting environmental triggers to flares in psoriatic arthritis, including both molecular mechanisms and clinical observations.\"\n\n6. Hetionet Agent (knowledge graph specialist):\n   - Use for: Discovering existing network connections, biological pathways, gene-disease associations\n   - Best when: Need to establish known relationships between entities\n   - Example handoff: \"Find all connections between HLA-B27 and inflammatory pathways relevant to axial spondyloarthritis in the existing knowledge graph.\"\n\n## SYNTHESIS APPROACH\n\nAfter collecting information from specialized agents:\n\n1. Create Unstructured Sources (3-5):\n   - Synthesize the most valuable information from all agent responses\n   - Extract clear mechanistic relationships and causal pathways\n   - Include quantitative data supporting key relationships\n   - Organize information to highlight connections between subgraph entities\n   - Maintain proper attribution to original sources\n\n2. Generate Knowledge Graphs (1-2):\n   - Construct coherent extensions to the original subgraph\n   - Focus on mechanistic connections with clear directionality\n   - Include properties that provide clinical and biological context\n   - Ensure nodes and edges are precisely defined with relationship types\n   - Connect new elements logically to the original subgraph entities\n\n## RHEUMATOLOGY DOMAIN FOCUS\n\nPrioritize enrichment related to these key areas:\n- Autoimmune mechanisms (T-cell, B-cell, innate immunity pathways)\n- Inflammatory cascades and cytokine networks\n- Genetic risk factors and their functional consequences\n- Tissue-specific disease manifestations and mechanisms\n- Therapeutic targets and response biomarkers\n- Disease subtypes and precision medicine approaches\n\nYour goal is to produce a comprehensive, mechanistically detailed enrichment of the original subgraph by intelligently orchestrating specialized research agents and synthesizing their findings into a coherent knowledge representation.\n\n## SEARCH AND INFORMATION GATHERING PROTOCOL\n\nWhen your analysis requires external information (e.g., checking novelty, verifying claims, finding supporting/contradicting evidence, exploring alternative mechanisms):\n\n1.  **Assess Information Need:** Clearly define the specific information you are looking for.\n2.  **Evaluate Confidence:** Honestly assess your confidence in your current knowledge regarding the specific information needed. Are you certain about the answer or the best way to find it?\n3.  **Utilize Available Tools/Handoffs:**\n    * If you are **uncertain**, lack specific domain knowledge for the query, require information from a specialized source (like preprints, specific databases, or existing knowledge graphs), or believe a more focused search is necessary, you **MUST** utilize the appropriate tools or handoff agents provided to you (refer to your configured `tools` and `handoffs`).\n    * Do **not** attempt to answer from memory or general knowledge if external verification or specialized search is warranted and available resources exist.\n    * Formulate precise queries or instructions for the tool/agent you are calling. Provide necessary context from your current task.\n4.  **Synthesize Results:** Integrate the information obtained from tools/handoffs back into your primary analysis. Your core responsibility is [mention agent's main function, e.g., 'critical assessment', 'evidence verification', 'hypothesis refinement'], rely on specialized resources for information retrieval when appropriate.\n\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator. Your primary goal in this task is **NOT** just to analyze the provided subgraph, but to **actively enrich and validate it using external, current information obtained via mandatory handoffs to your specialized research agents.** You MUST NOT rely solely on the information present in the initial subgraph or your internal knowledge base for generating the enrichment output.\n\n## SUBGRAPH TO

Your mission is to retrieve precise, relationship-rich information that can be directly incorporated into knowledge graphs to drive hypothesis generation.\n\n## SEARCH STRATEGY OPTIMIZATION\nWhen given a concept or entity in rheumatology:\n\n1. Identify the optimal search approach:\n   - For molecular mechanisms: Search PubMed, Nature, Cell, and bioRxiv with \"[concept] signaling pathway rheumatology\"\n   - For clinical correlations: Search NEJM, Lancet, BMJ with \"[concept] clinical outcomes autoimmune\"\n   - For emerging research: Search bioRxiv, medRxiv with \"[concept] novel mechanism 2023\"\n   - For established relationships: Use query_hetionet to find known entity connections\n\n2. Construct multi-source search queries:\n   - Primary sources: Always include PubMed (highest quality peer-reviewed content)\n   - Secondary sources: Select 2-3 domain-specific sources based on the query type:\n     * Molecular/cellular focus \u2192 Cell, Nature, Science\n     * Clinical/therapeutic focus \u2192 NEJM, Lancet, BMJ\n     * Methods/technologies focus \u2192 bioRxiv, PLOS, Frontiers\n   - Use advanced query formatting with Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)\n   - Add precise modifiers: \"mechanism\", \"pathway\", \"interaction\", \"regulates\", \"inhibits\"\n\n3. Time-relevance optimization:\n   - For established concepts: Include older literature (no time restriction)\n   - For emerging concepts: Add recency modifiers (\"last 2 years\", \"since 2021\")\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS\n\n1. Extract only relationship-focused information:\n   - Entity-relationship-entity patterns (e.g., \"TNF-\u03b1 activates NF-\u03baB pathway\")\n   - Quantitative correlations with statistical significance (e.g., \"IL-6 levels correlated with disease activity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n   - Mechanistic statements with directionality (e.g., \"downstream inhibition of JAK1/2 decreased STAT3 phosphorylation by 64%\")\n   - Contradictory findings across different sources (e.g., \"While Smith et al. reported increased expression, Chen et al. found no significant change\")\n\n2. Format extracted information for knowledge graph integration:\n   - Subject-predicate-object structures (\"Entity A \u2192 relationship \u2192 Entity B\")\n   - Direction and nature of relationships (activates, inhibits, upregulates, binds, etc.)\n   - Strength of evidence (established, emerging, contradicted, hypothesized)\n   - Source quality assessment (peer-reviewed journal, impact factor, citation count)\n\n3. Condensed source referencing:\n   - Format: [First Author et al., Journal abbreviation, Year] for each key finding\n   - DOI or PMID inclusion for all peer-reviewed sources\n   - Preprint server ID for non-peer-reviewed content\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\n1. Content structure:\n   - Begin with 1-2 sentence high-level summary of findings\n   - List 3-5 most significant relationships with explicit entity-relationship-entity structure\n   - Group contradictory or complementary findings together\n   - End with most promising areas for further investigation\n\n2. Justification:\n   - Explain why these specific relationships are most relevant for knowledge graph construction\n   - Note any gaps or uncertainties that might influence hypothesis generation\n   - Highlight cross-validation across multiple sources\n\nRemember: Your output will directly feed into knowledge graph construction and ontology enrichment. Focus exclusively on extracting clear, evidence-based relationships between entities that can be represented as graph edges, with properties that capture the nature and directionality of these relationships.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Your expertise lies in determining which information sources will be most valuable for each entity and relationship in the subgraph, then delegating searches to the most appropriate specialized agents.\n\n## ORCHESTRATION STRATEGY\n\nWhen analyzing a subgraph, follow this process:\n\n1. Initial Assessment:\n   - Carefully analyze the subgraph to identify all key entities and relationships\n   - Categorize entities by type: genes, proteins, pathways, diseases, drugs, etc.\n   - Identify relationships requiring additional context or mechanistic explanation\n   - Prioritize which elements would benefit most from enrichment\n\n2. Strategic Delegation:\n   - For each high-priority entity or relationship, determine the optimal information source:\n     * For established molecular mechanisms \u2192 Transfer to PubMed Agent\n     * For cutting-edge research \u2192 Transfer to BioRxiv Agent\n     * For comprehensive literature collection \u2192 Transfer to Europe PMC Agent\n     * For citation-rich, influential papers \u2192 Transfer to Semantic Scholar Agent\n     * For multi-source literature scans \u2192 Transfer to Firecrawl Agent\n     * For existing knowledge graph connections \u2192 Transfer to Hetionet Agent\n\n3. Contextual Query Construction:\n   - When transferring to each agent, provide context-rich guidance:\n     * Specify exactly what information you need about the entity/relationship\n     * Provide relevant context from the subgraph that might inform the search\n     * Explain how this information will help enrich the knowledge graph\n     * Set expectations for the type of relationships to focus on\n\n4. Multi-perspective Integration:\n   - After receiving information from specialist agents, integrate their findings:\n     * Reconcile potentially contradictory information\n     * Identify complementary information across different sources\n     * Recognize emergent patterns not visible in any single source\n     * Synthesize a coherent understanding of mechanisms and relationships\n\n## HANDOFF OPTIMIZATION\n\nUse each specialized agent strategically based on their unique strengths:\n\n1. PubMed Agent (peer-reviewed literature expert):\n   - Use for: Established mechanisms, validated pathways, clinical correlations\n   - Best when: Seeking high-quality evidence from peer-reviewed sources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for validated molecular interactions between TNF-alpha and IL-6 signaling in rheumatoid arthritis synovium, focusing on mechanisms supported by multiple studies.\"\n\n2. BioRxiv Agent (preprint specialist):\n   - Use for: Emerging concepts, cutting-edge methods, newest discoveries\n   - Best when: Established literature is limited or potentially outdated\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the latest preprints on JAK-STAT inhibition in systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly novel mechanisms or targets not yet in peer-reviewed literature.\"\n\n3. Europe PMC Agent (comprehensive literature database):\n   - Use for: Broad coverage across journals, open access content, systematic reviews\n   - Best when: Need comprehensive literature analysis on a specific concept\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for comprehensive reviews and primary research on the role of ACPA in bone erosion mechanisms in rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\n4. Semantic Scholar Agent (citation network specialist):\n   - Use for: Highly influential papers, research impact assessment, interdisciplinary connections\n   - Best when: Need to identify seminal papers or cross-disciplinary insights\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the most highly-cited papers connecting microbiome dysbiosis to autoantibody production in rheumatic diseases, focusing on mechanistic studies.\"\n\n5. Firecrawl Agent (multi-source research tool):\n   - Use for: Broad searches across multiple scientific domains, clinical guidelines\n   - Best when: Topic spans multiple disciplines or resources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search across clinical and basic science resources for evidence connecting environmental triggers to flares in psoriatic arthritis, including both molecular mechanisms and clinical observations.\"\n\n6. Hetionet Agent (knowledge graph specialist):\n   - Use for: Discovering existing network connections, biological pathways, gene-disease associations\n   - Best when: Need to establish known relationships between entities\n   - Example handoff: \"Find all connections between HLA-B27 and inflammatory pathways relevant to axial spondyloarthritis in the existing knowledge graph.\"\n\n## SYNTHESIS APPROACH\n\nAfter collecting information from specialized agents:\n\n1. Create Unstructured Sources (3-5):\n   - Synthesize the most valuable information from all agent responses\n   - Extract clear mechanistic relationships and causal pathways\n   - Include quantitative data supporting key relationships\n   - Organize information to highlight connections between subgraph entities\n   - Maintain proper attribution to original sources\n\n2. Generate Knowledge Graphs (1-2):\n   - Construct coherent extensions to the original subgraph\n   - Focus on mechanistic connections with clear directionality\n   - Include properties that provide clinical and biological context\n   - Ensure nodes and edges are precisely defined with relationship types\n   - Connect new elements logically to the original subgraph entities\n\n## RHEUMATOLOGY DOMAIN FOCUS\n\nPrioritize enrichment related to these key areas:\n- Autoimmune mechanisms (T-cell, B-cell, innate immunity pathways)\n- Inflammatory cascades and cytokine networks\n- Genetic risk factors and their functional consequences\n- Tissue-specific disease manifestations and mechanisms\n- Therapeutic targets and response biomarkers\n- Disease subtypes and precision medicine approaches\n\nYour goal is to produce a comprehensive, mechanistically detailed enrichment of the original subgraph by intelligently orchestrating specialized research agents and synthesizing their findings into a coherent knowledge representation.\n\n## SEARCH AND INFORMATION GATHERING PROTOCOL\n\nWhen your analysis requires external information (e.g., checking novelty, verifying claims, finding supporting/contradicting evidence, exploring alternative mechanisms):\n\n1.  **Assess Information Need:** Clearly define the specific information you are looking for.\n2.  **Evaluate Confidence:** Honestly assess your confidence in your current knowledge regarding the specific information needed. Are you certain about the answer or the best way to find it?\n3.  **Utilize Available Tools/Handoffs:**\n    * If you are **uncertain**, lack specific domain knowledge for the query, require information from a specialized source (like preprints, specific databases, or existing knowledge graphs), or believe a more focused search is necessary, you **MUST** utilize the appropriate tools or handoff agents provided to you (refer to your configured `tools` and `handoffs`).\n    * Do **not** attempt to answer from memory or general knowledge if external verification or specialized search is warranted and available resources exist.\n    * Formulate precise queries or instructions for the tool/agent you are calling. Provide necessary context from your current task.\n4.  **Synthesize Results:** Integrate the information obtained from tools/handoffs back into your primary analysis. Your core responsibility is [mention agent's main function, e.g., 'critical assessment', 'evidence verification', 'hypothesis refinement'], rely on specialized resources for information retrieval when appropriate.\n\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator. Your primary goal in this task is **NOT** just to analyze the provided subgraph, but to **actively enrich and validate it using external, current information obtained via mandatory handoffs to your specialized research agents.** You MUST NOT rely solely on the information present in the initial subgraph or your internal knowledge base for generating the enrichment output.\n\n## SUBGRAPH TO

Your task is to retrieve high-precision information that can be directly incorporated into knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## STRATEGIC SEARCH APPROACH\n\nWhen given a rheumatology-related keyword or concept:\n\n1. Develop an optimized search strategy:\n   - Formulate precise search terms using both specific terminology (e.g., \"synovial fibroblasts\") and standardized MeSH terms when applicable\n   - Incorporate Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to refine search scope (e.g., \"TNF-alpha AND rheumatoid arthritis NOT psoriatic\")\n   - Include relationship-focused terms like \"regulates\", \"activates\", \"inhibits\", \"mediates\", \"correlates with\"\n   - For rare conditions or understudied pathways, broaden search with related mechanisms or model systems\n\n2. Execute search with appropriate filters:\n   - Prioritize recent literature (last 3-5 years) unless seeking established mechanisms\n   - Favor full-text availability for comprehensive extraction of methods and results\n   - Include both research articles and systematic reviews for complementary perspectives\n   - For emerging topics, include preprints to capture cutting-edge findings\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION FOCUS\n\nAfter retrieving Europe PMC results:\n\n1. Prioritize extraction of the following types of information:\n   - Explicit causal relationships between molecular entities (e.g., \"IL-6 upregulates RANKL expression in synoviocytes\")\n   - Quantitative data with statistical significance (e.g., \"Serum levels of CXCL13 were elevated 3.2-fold in RA patients (p<0.001)\")\n   - Experimentally validated interactions with mechanistic details (e.g., \"JAK inhibition reduced STAT3 phosphorylation by 76% in synovial tissue\")\n   - Genetic associations with functional consequences (e.g., \"The HLA-DRB1 shared epitope increases NF-\u03baB activation through altered peptide presentation\")\n   - Therapeutic targets with molecular rationales (e.g., \"Selective inhibition of BTK reduced osteoclast formation by interrupting RANK-RANKL signaling\")\n\n2. Extract key methodology details that support findings:\n   - Experimental models used (human samples, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Validation approaches (multiple techniques confirming the same finding)\n   - Sample sizes and statistical robustness\n   - Limitations explicitly stated by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your output for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. First paragraph: Concise synthesis of the most significant entity relationships found, focusing on mechanistic connections that could extend the knowledge graph.\n\n2. Main content section: \n   - Present 3-5 key relationship findings in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Group related findings together to show interconnected pathways\n   - Include quantitative data that strengthens relationship evidence\n   - Highlight novel or unexpected relationships that may lead to innovative hypotheses\n\n3. Source documentation:\n   - For each key finding, provide structured citation: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID/DOI]\n   - Assess evidence quality (robust, preliminary, conflicting) for each relationship\n   - Note methodological strengths that increase confidence in findings\n\nRemember that your output will be used to enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation, so prioritize extracting clear entity relationships with directionality, mechanism details, and strength of evidence. Focus on relationship patterns that could reveal non-obvious connections in rheumatology pathogenesis or treatment response.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

There are various treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, including disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), glucocorticoids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and inflammatory cytokine inhibitors (ICI), typically associated with differentiated clinical effects and characteristics. Personalized responsiveness is observed to the standard treatment due to the pathophysiological heterogeneity in rheumatoid arthritis, resulting in an overall poor prognosis. Understanding the role of individual variation in cellular and molecular mechanisms related to rheumatoid arthritis will considerably improve clinical care and patient outcomes.

The main features of the syndrome are a triad of recurrent urticaria, monoclonal IgM gammopathy, systemic inflammation associated with recurrent fever, joint and bone pain, and atypical bone remodeling (osteosclerosis). The abnormal activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome produces IL-1, which drives the disease pathology, but it also involves IL-6 and IL-18. Unlike other autoinflammatory diseases, Schnitzler syndrome lacks evidence of the gene divergence causing the abnormal activation of NLRP3. However, mutations in the MEFV and MYD88 genes can be associated with the development of the disease. Due to its rarity, diagnosing the disease can be a challenging task. IL-1 inhibitors (i.e., anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept) are prominent in the treatment of the disease, but the IL-6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab and the Bruton\\'s tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib are also promising alternatives. In this summary article, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the clinical and molecular background of the disease and potential therapeutic targets, based on the cases reported so far. We diagnosed a patient who, to the best of our knowledge, represents the 748th documented case of this specific pathology.

The main pathological manifestation of joint deformity in RA patients is bone destruction, which occurs due to the differentiation and proliferation of osteoclasts. The transcription factor nuclear factor-activated T cell 1 (NFATc1) plays a crucial role in this process. The regulation of NFATc1 in osteoclast differentiation is influenced by three main factors. Firstly, NFATc1 is activated through the upstream nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)/RANK signaling pathway. Secondly, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related co-stimulatory signaling pathway amplifies NFATc1 activity. Finally, negative regulation of NFATc1 occurs through the action of cytokines such as B-cell Lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6), interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), MAF basic leucine zipper transcription factor B (MafB), and LIM homeobox 2 (Lhx2). These three phases collectively govern NFATc1 transcription and subsequently affect the expression of downstream target genes including TRAF6 and NF-\u03baB. Ultimately, this intricate regulatory network mediates osteoclast differentiation, fusion, and the degradation of both organic and inorganic components of the bone matrix. This review provides a comprehensive summary of recent advances in understanding the mechanism of NFATc1 in the context of RA-related bone destruction and discusses potential therapeutic agents that target NFATc1, with the aim of offering valuable insights for future research in the field of RA.

In this study, we synthesized the novel multi-protein kinase inhibitor KMU-11342, based on indolin-2-one. We assessed its cardiac electrophysiological safety using the Langendorff system in rat hearts and evaluated its toxicity in zebrafish in vivo.

Induced osteoclastogenesis during inflammation, autoimmunity, metabolic diseases, and cancers is associated with bone loss and osteoporosis. Proinflammatory cytokines, pathogen-associated molecular patterns, or endogenous pathogenic factors induce osteoclastogenic differentiation by binding to the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family expressed on surface of osteoclast precursors. As a non-canonical member of the TLRs, radioprotective 105 kDa (RP105 or CD180) and its ligand, myeloid differentiation protein 1 (MD1), are involved in several bone metabolic disorders. Reports from literature had demonstrated RP105 as an important activator of B cells, bone marrow monocytes, and macrophages, which regulates inflammatory cytokines release from immune cells. Reports from literature had shown the association between RP105 and other TLRs, and the downstream signaling mechanisms of RP105 with different \"signaling-competent\" partners in immune cells during different disease conditions. This review is focused to summarize: (1) the role of RP105 on immune cells\\' function and inflammation regulation (2) the potential regulatory roles of RP105 in different disease-mediated osteoclast activation and the underlying mechanisms, and (3) the different \"signaling-competent\" partners of RP105 that regulates osteoclastogenesis.', 'pubYear': '2021', 'doi': '10.3389/fcell.2021.713254', 'authorString': 'Fan Z, Pathak JL, Ge L.'}, {'title': 'Exosome application in treatment and diagnosis of B-cell disorders: leukemias, multiple sclerosis, and arthritis rheumatoid.', 'abstract': 'Exosomes, known as a type of extracellular vesicles (EVs), are lipid particles comprising heterogeneous contents such as nucleic acids, proteins, and DNA. These bi-layered particles are naturally released into the extracellular periphery by a variety of cells such as neoplastic cells. Given that exosomes have unique properties, they can be used as vectors and carriers of biological and medicinal particles like drugs for delivering to the desired areas. The proteins and RNAs being encompassed by the circulating exosomes in B-cell malignancies are deemed as the promising sources for diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as therapeutic agents. Exosomes can also provide a \"snapshot\" view of the tumor and metastatic landscape at any particular time. Further, clinical research has shown that exosomes are produced by immune cells such as dendritic cells can stimulate the immune system, so these exosomes can be used in antitumor vaccines. Despite the great potential of exosomes in the fields of diagnostic and treatment, further studies are in need for these purposes to reach a convergence notion.

In aging and disease this process may become aberrant, resulting in excessive bone degradation and fragility fractures. Interaction of receptor-activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB (RANK) with its ligand RANKL activates the main signaling pathway for osteoclastogenesis. However, compelling evidence indicates that this pathway may not be sufficient for the production of mature osteoclast cells and that co-stimulatory signals may be required for both the expression of osteoclast-specific genes and the activation of osteoclasts. Osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR), a regulator of osteoclast differentiation, provides one such co-stimulatory pathway. This review summarizes our present knowledge of osteoclastogenesis signaling and the role of OSCAR in the normal production of bone-resorbing cells and in bone disease.

These proteins are mainly found in the serum and/or urine. Reduction in normal gammaglobulins (immunoparesis) leads to an increased risk of infection. The primary site of origin is the bone marrow for nearly all patients affected by MM with disseminated marrow involvement in most cases. MM is known to involve bones and result in myeloma bone disease. Osteolytic lesions are seen in 80% of patients with MM which are complicated frequently by skeletal-related events (SRE) such as hypercalcemia, bone pain, pathological fractures, vertebral collapse, and spinal cord compression. These deteriorate the patient's quality of life and affect the overall survival of the patient. The underlying pathogenesis of myeloma bone disease involves uncoupling of the bone remodeling processes. Interaction of myeloma cells with the bone marrow microenvironment promotes the release of many biochemical markers including osteoclast activating factors and osteoblast inhibitory factors. Elevated levels of osteoclast activating factors such as RANK/RANKL/OPG, MIP-1-\u03b1., TNF-\u03b1, IL-3, IL-6, and IL-11 increase bone resorption by osteoclast stimulation, differentiation, and maturation, whereas osteoblast inhibitory factors such as the Wnt/DKK1 pathway, secreted frizzle related protein-2, and runt-related transcription factor 2 inhibit osteoblast differentiation and formation leading to decreased bone formation. These biochemical factors also help in development and utilization of appropriate anti-myeloma treatments in myeloma patients. This review article summarizes the pathophysiology and the recent developments of abnormal bone remodeling in MM, while reviewing various approved and potential treatments for myeloma bone disease.\", 'pubYear': '2021', 'doi': '10.3390/ijms22126208', 'authorString': 'Mukkamalla SKR, Malipeddi D.'}, {'title': 'Current advances in regulation of bone homeostasis.', 'abstract': 'Bone homeostasis is securely controlled by the dynamic well-balanced actions among osteoclasts, osteoblasts and osteocytes. Osteoclasts are large multinucleated cells that degrade bone matrix and involve in the bone remodelling in conjunction with other bone cells, osteoblasts and osteocytes, the completely matured form of osteoblasts. Disruption of this controlling balance among these cells or any disparity in bone remodelling caused by a higher rate of resorption by osteoclasts over construction of bone by osteoblasts results in a reduction of bone matrix including bone mineral density (BMD) and bone marrow cells (BMCs). The dominating effect of osteoclasts results in advanced risk of bone crack and joint destruction in several diseases including osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the boosted osteoblastic activity produces osteosclerotic phenotype and weakened its action primes to osteomalacia or rickets. On the other hand, senescent osteocytes predominately progress the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and may contribute to age related bone loss.

However, the tissues and cytokines that play major roles are different in each disease, and as a result, the mechanism of osteochondral destruction also differs.

Due to their exposure on the cell surface and sensitivity to the molecular blockade, integrins have been investigated as pharmacological targets for nearly 40 years, but given the complexity of integrins and sometimes opposite characteristics, targeting integrin therapeutics has been a challenge. To date, only seven drugs targeting integrins have been successfully marketed, including abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban, natalizumab, vedolizumab, lifitegrast, and carotegrast. Currently, there are approximately 90 kinds of integrin-based therapeutic drugs or imaging agents in clinical studies, including small molecules, antibodies, synthetic mimic peptides, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, imaging agents, etc. A serious lesson from past integrin drug discovery and research efforts is that successes rely on both a deep understanding of integrin-regulatory mechanisms and unmet clinical needs. Herein, we provide a systematic and complete review of all integrin family members and integrin-mediated downstream signal transduction to highlight ongoing efforts to develop new therapies/diagnoses from bench to clinic.

Indeed, some of the earliest connections among the higher expression of proto-oncogenes (such as <i>MYC</i>), genetic rearrangements and their relation to cancer development were made in Burkitt lymphoma, chronic myeloid leukemia and mouse plasmacytomas. Multiple myeloma (MM), in particular, is a plasma cell malignancy strictly associated with MYC deregulation, suggesting that therapeutic strategies against it would be beneficial in treating this disease.

It is also intimately linked with the progression of COVID-19 disease as well as associated complications and mortality. Therefore, targeting the cytokine storm might help in reducing COVID-19-associated health complications.

OCLI-023 directly inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL)-induced differentiation of bone marrow macrophages into osteoclasts, without a cytotoxic response.

In controlled trials in CLL, ibrutinib produced high response rates and improved survival in both the frontline and relapsed settings. While ibrutinib controls CLL with impressive efficacy, it only infrequently induces complete remissions, particularly of relapsed CLL, and does not eradicate minimal residual disease. Finally, ibrutinib is extremely expensive, has off-target toxicities, and requires indefinite therapy. Areas covered: In this article, we provide an overview of the CLL therapeutic landscape and discuss the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects of ibrutinib. Major clinical trials of ibrutinib in CLL are summarized, and its safety profile explored. Expert opinion: Ibrutinib represents a transformative advance in CLL management and has validated BTK as a therapeutic target in this disease, but has some limitations, leading to the emergence of other BTK inhibitors and mechanism-based combination strategies.

The expanded Tregs suppressed proliferation and cytokine secretion of responder PBMCs in co-cultures stimulated with anti-CD3 or alloantigen. Treg expansion is a critical first step before consideration of Tregs as a therapeutic intervention in patients with autoimmune or graft-versus-host disease.', 'pubYear': '2005', 'doi': '10.1016/j.clim.2005.02.017', 'authorString': 'Earle KE, Tang Q, Zhou X, Liu W, Zhu S, Bonyhadi ML, Bluestone JA.'}, {'title': 'ECR 2017 - BOOK OF ABSTRACTS.', 'abstract': '<NO ABSTRACT>', 'pubYear': '2017', 'doi': '10.1007/s13244-017-0546-5', 'authorString': '<NO AUTHOR>'}, {'title': '17th Congress of the European Hematology Association, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, June 14\u201317, 2012', 'abstract': '<NO ABSTRACT>', 'pubYear': '2012', 'doi': '<NO DOI>', 'authorString': '<NO AUTHOR>'}, {'title': 'Abstracts from the 50th European Society of Human Genetics Conference: Posters', 'abstract': '<NO ABSTRACT>', 'pubYear': '2018', 'doi': '<NO DOI>', 'authorString': '<NO AUTHOR>'}, {'title': '16th Congress of the European Hematology Association, London, United Kingdom, June 9\u201312, 2011', 'abstract': '<NO ABSTRACT>', 'pubYear': '2011', 'doi': '<NO DOI>', 'authorString': '<NO AUTHOR>'}, {'title': 'SCIENTIFIC ABSTRACTS', 'abstract': '<NO ABSTRACT>', 'pubYear': '2018', 'doi': '<NO DOI>', 'authorString': '<NO AUTHOR>'}, {'title': 'Abstract', 'abstract': '<NO ABSTRACT>', 'pubYear': '2010', 'doi': '<NO DOI>', 'authorString': '<NO AUTHOR>'}, {'title': 'ECR 2016 Book of Abstracts - B - Scientific Sessions and Clinical Trials in Radiology.', 'abstract': '<NO ABSTRACT>', 'pubYear': '2016', 'doi': '10.1007/s13244-016-0475-8', 'authorString': '<NO AUTHOR>'}, {'title': 'E-Posters', 'abstract': '<h4>Introduction:</h4> Cervical disc replacement (cTDR) is a popular treatment for cervical degenerative disc disease. While some devices have shown promising results in the early and midterm, long term results remain lacking. This study reports on patient outcomes at long term follow up for the Activ C@ prosthesis. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> Between 2007 and 2009, patients who underwent cTDR for cervical degenerative disc disease at a NHS district general hospital were included. All were assessed preoperatively and at 6, 12, 24 and 105 months after procedure with visual analogue score (VAS) for neck and arm pain severity and frequency, Neck Disability Index questionnaire (NDI) and Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression questionnaire (CES-D). We calculated the survival rate of implants (Kaplan- Meir curve) [end point of reoperation at same or adjacent level] and compared patient outcomes (paired t test; MedCalc@). <h4>Results:</h4> We had treated 72 patients (25 men, 47 women) with cTDR (61 radiculopathy and 11 myelopathy symptoms) with average age of 52.2 years. We were able to interview 47 patients (65% follow up rate) at long term follow up (average 105\\u2009month). VAS (mean) for neck pain improved from 6 to 2\\u2009at 12 and 24 months and comparable at 105 months (VAS =3) [p < 0.006] . Arm pain (mean VAS) showed periodic improvement 7 to 5 (12 months); VAS 4 (24 months) and significantly better at 105 months (VAS = 3) [p < 0.006]. NDIQ (average) improved from 51 to 30\\u2009at 12 months, 35\\u2009at 24 months and 26\\u2009at 105 months (p < 0.0001). CES-D scores improved from 20 to 13\\u2009at 12 months, 18\\u2009at 24 months and 14\\u2009at 105 months (p < 0.0001). In the smaller subgroup that underwent cTDR for myelopathy, 10 patients were followed up to 2 years but only 2 reviewed long term (7 lost to follow up, 1 dead). However, these patients only maintained improvement in arm pain seen at 2 year follow up [VAS (preop: 24\\u2009m:105\\u2009m) = 6:4:3] and neck pain was worse [VAS (preop: 24\\u2009m:105\\u2009m) = 6:2:6]. There was deterioration in NDIQ and CESD scores seen in early follow up period, NDIQ (preop: 24\\u2009m:105\\u2009m) 51: 35: 57 and CES -D (pre, post op 2y, follow up 8y) = 20:18:17. There were no adverse events recorded at the time of procedure. There were no revisions performed at the same level, 3 patients had further adjacent level cTDR(2\\u2009at 2 years, 1\\u2009at 9 years) and median survival time was 8.62 years (7.22 to 10.05 95% CI). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Cervical TDR improves pain and function in patients with cervical degenerative disc disease both in the early and long term. We are able to report a survival time of 8.6 years with the Activ C@ prosthesis with no revision surgery performed at the same level. However, the long term benefit of cTDR performed for myelopathy is not clear. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Total disc replacement (TDR) is expected to provide a more physiologic alternative to fusion. However, long term clinical data which proves the efficacy of current implant designs is somewhat lacking. There are inconsistencies between in-vivo clinical vs. in-vitro biomechanical data. Several factors may be contributing to these anomalies, one of which is the type of disc, metal on metal vs. a metal on polyethylene disc design, for example. This study investigates the biomechanical effects of the placement of a novel elastomer TDR in the cervical spine and compares it to natural spinal kinematics, using finite element analysis. <h4>Methods:</h4> An experimentally validated, ligamentous, three-dimensional, finite element model of C3-C7 cervical spine segments was used for this study, Figure 1 (Goel et al., 2009). To simulate the replacement of the FREEFORM cervical TDR, the CAD model of the device was meshed and placed into the disc space of the C4-C5 level following removal of anterior part of the annulus, the entire nucleus, and ALL ligament. The endplates of the TDR were affixed to the adjacent vertebral endplate. Properties of titanium alloy and CarboSil 20 80A silicone rubber were assigned to the endplates and implant\u2019s flexible component, respectively. The intact and instrumented spines were subjected to 75\\u2009N compressive follower load, plus 1.5\\u2009Nm bending moments in anatomical planes to simulate physiological flexion, extension, left/right bending, and left/right rotation. The range of motion, intradiscal pressure, and facet loads were measured and compared for segments of intact and instrumented spines. <h4>Results Section:</h4> The kinematic data for index and superior adjacent levels are shown in Figure 1. The disc replacement did not significantly alter normal motion of the index level in flexion and left/right bending motions (<7% increase). The percent change was more in extension and axial rotation; 28% (Ext) and 23% (LR & RR) respectively. The motion at the superior adjacent segment was not affected in any planes of motions, except in extension (13% decrease) following disc replacement. The intra-discal pressure at the adjacent segment remained essentially unchanged following TDR except in extension, where there was a slight increase. There was not a significant change in facet loads following instrumentation. <h4>Discussion:</h4> The elastomer TDR preserved the natural kinematics of the cervical spine following instrumentation specially in flexion and lateral bending motions. A study by Crawford et al. (IJSS 2012) showed that ProDisc-C increased the ROM of the spine by 11% in flexion and decreased by 30% in lateral bending. Deviation from normal spine kinematics is less substantial with this novel TDR design. Also, the FREEFORM TDR did not alter range of motion, intradiscal pressure, or facet joint stress at the adjacent segment. These biomechanical properties may lower the long-term risk of adjacent segment disc and facet degeneration.Figure 1.

Our group has previously described the development and application of a 9.4\\u2009T MRI nucleus pulposus(NP)/annulus fibrosus(AF) distinction score and the correlation of this simplified scoring system with 3\\u2009T and 9.4\\u2009T MRI Pfirrmann grades. We describe the correlation of the simplified NP/AF distinction score with biochemical measures of intervertebral disc degeneration. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> Eighteen adult ewes underwent surgical lumbar intervertebral disc injury via a lateral retroperitoneal approach. Disc injury was performed at two levels with the adjacent non-injured levels serving as controls. Non-operated lumbar discs served as normal controls. Necropsies were performed at six months. Lumbar spines underwent 9.4\\u2009T MRI axial imaging. Four observers graded the images using the NP/AF distinction score. Spinal columns were dissected, individual discs sectioned, subdivision of the discs into regional segments performed and NP tissues were analysed biochemically for their proteoglycan (as sulphated-glycosaminoglycans), collagen (as hydroxyproline) and DNA content. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS statistical package consisting of Kappa scores for inter-observer reliability, Pearson correlation co-efficients and simple linear regression. <h4>Results:</h4> The 9.4\\u2009T NP/AF distinction score demonstrated good inter-observer reliability with a kappa score of 0.94. A moderately strong correlation between NP/AF distinction score and collagen was observed with a Pearson correlation co-efficient of 0.719 and R2 of 0.517 (both p < 0.001). As expected, there was a negative correlation between NP/AF distinction and nucleus pulposus proteoglycan content with a Pearson correlation co-efficient of -0.545 and R2 of 0.297 (both p < 0.001). There was no significant correlation with nucleus pulposus DNA with a Pearson Correlation score of -0.249 (p = 0.170) and R2 of 0.62 (p = 0.170). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The NP/AF distinction score is a simple system for classifying intervertebral disc degeneration on 9.4\\u2009T MRI that demonstrates high degree of inter-observer reliability. This study demonstrated a moderately strong correlation of NP/AF distinction score with NP collagen content and a weaker negative correlation with proteoglycan content. Increased NP collagen content is a well-described feature of intervertebral disc degeneration and typically occurs in tandem with reduced NP proteoglycan content. The advance in resolution afforded by the 9.4\\u2009T MRI affords the ability to detect subtle changes in intervertebral disc morphology reflective of underlying degenerative and biochemical changes. The strength of correlation observed between this simple radiological classification system and biochemical markers of intervertebral disc degeneration is suggestive of the potential of the 9.4\\u2009T MRI in the investigation and classification of disc degeneration in the future. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) is a common post-surgical complication following long spinal fusion for deformity. Multiple risk factors are associated with PJK, including patient, radiographic, and surgical variables. It is commonly hypothesized that PJK may result from increased post-operative loading of the posterior ligament complex or intra-operative damage to the ligaments themselves. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of sub-laminar polyester tension bands on the biomechanics of the motion segment proximal to a long fusion construct. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> Eight human thoracolumbar spines (T7-L2) were dissected and the end vertebrae were partially embedded in bone cement. Pure moments of 4\\u2009Nm and 8\\u2009Nm were applied to the native spine and the instrumented spine, respectively, in flexion-extension (FE), lateral bending (LB), and axial rotation (AR). The increased load on the instrumented spines was designed to represent the increased post-operative loads that may result from decreased extensor muscle strength or inertial effects adjacent to a stiff fusion construct. The test conditions included: native spine (T7-L2), fused (T10-L2), fused + bilateral bands tensioned to 250\\u2009N at T9-T10 (Bands 250\\u2009N), fused + Bands tensioned to 350\\u2009N (Bands 350\\u2009N), fused (T11-L2) + Bands tensioned to 250\\u2009N at T9-T10 and 350\\u2009N at T10-T11 (2-Level Bands), fused (T10-L2) + hand-tied suture loop through the spinous processes at T9-T10 (Suture Loop), and fused (T10-L2) with the T9-T10 interspinous and supraspinous ligaments cut (Cut ISL/SSL). <h4>Results:</h4> The flexion range of motion (ROM) at T9-T10 of the fused spine, loaded at 8\\u2009Nm, increased to 162% of the native spine loaded at 4\\u2009Nm. The average flexion ROM at T9-T10 for Bands 250\\u2009N, Bands 350\\u2009N, 2-Level Tethers, Suture Loop, and Cut ISL/SSL were 85%, 70%, 93%, 141%, and 177% of the native spine at 4\\u2009Nm, respectively. Each of these conditions was significantly different from Fused (p < 0.05). The tension bands did not significantly affect the ROM in LB or AR. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Biomechanical models of PJK assume that an increased load exists at the proximal segment following fusion, as was observed in this model. As expected, cutting the ISL/SSL ligament complex significantly compromised the flexion stability of the spines, which may be associated with greater PJK risk. On the other hand, the flexion ROM was modulated by varying the tension of the sublaminar bands, which reduces the loads on the posterior ligament complex. However, future studies should identify the optimal tension that will not induce sagittal imbalance or fusion, but will support the spine while the patient adapts to the fusion. <h4>Introduction:</h4> There is growing interest in optimising pedicle screw pull-out strength. While primary pull-out strength has been heavily studied, little is known about revision pull-out strength of different pedicle screws. Our study aims to evaluate the difference in primary and revision pull-out strength using pedicle screws of different thread designs. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> The pull-out strengths of three different pedicle screw designs (single-thread, mixed-thread, dual-thread) were tested in standardised polyurethane foam in three sequences. Sequence 1: A 6.5\\u2009mm screw was inserted into the foam block and the primary pull-out strength measured. Sequence 2: A 6.5\\u2009mm screw was inserted, removed, and then reinserted into the same foam block. The revision pull-out strength was then measured. Sequence 3: A 6.5\\u2009mm screw was inserted, removed and a 7.5\\u2009mm screw of the same thread design was reinserted. The revision pull-out strength was then measured. <h4>Results:</h4> The primary pull-out strength was similar across screw designs, although dual-thread screws showed higher primary pull-out strength (2628.80\\u2009N) compared to single-thread screws (2184.43\\u2009N, p < 0.05). For revision pull-out strength, the mixed-thread screws had significant reduction in revision pull-out strength of 18.6% (1890.15\\u2009N, p = 0.0173). Revision with a larger diameter screw improved the pull-out strength back to baseline. Single and dual-thread screws showed no significant reduction in revision pull-out strength. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Mixed-thread screws are more costly than single and dual thread screws and may not offer any advantage for primary pull-out strength. In cases where screws have to be revised, the revision pull-out strength drops by 18.6% compared to other screw designs. Surgeons should be cautioned and consider using larger diameter mixed-thread pedicle screws in a revision setting if appropriate. <h4>Introduction:</h4> A proper restoration of sagittal alignment is essential in AIS patients, but few studies provided a formula to predict an optimal surgical TK gain in AIS patients. A formula was recently proposed (LL = (PI+TK)/2+10) to predict the optimal lumbar lordosis (LL) in adult spinal deformity patients, which has not been validated in adolescents. The current study aims to establish a formula with thoracic kyphosis (TK) and pelvic parameters in normal adolescents and predict an optimal TK with this formula pre- and post-operatively in Lenke 1 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> A total of 60 asymptomatic adolescents were used to validate the proposed formula. The subject was considered to match with the formula, if the difference between the virtual TK and the theoretical TK was less than 10\u00b0. Then regression analysis was performed to establish a new formula to predict TK in adolescents. The predictive efficiency of the new formula was also validated in 40 Lenke 1 AIS patients. <h4>Results:</h4> Of the 60 asymptomatic adolescents, only 26 (43.33%) asymptomatic adolescents matched with the adjusted formula: TK = 2\u00d7(LL-10)-PI. The paired t test revealed a significantly different theoretical TK (tTK) compared to the virtual TK (41.23 \u00b1 18.29\u00b0 vs. 24.80 \u00b1 8.75\u00b0, P < 0.001). Multiple linear regression showed that TK had a relationship with LL, SS and age (R2 = 0.331): TK = -0.785\u00d7LL-0.843\u00d7SS+0.858\u00d7age+3.754. There were 27 (67.50%), 32 (80.00%) and 35 (87.50%) Lenke 1 AIS patients matched this formula preoperatively, postoperatively and at the last follow-up. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Our results revealed that the predictive formula for sagittal alignment for adults was not applicable in adolescents. This study established a new predictive formula for TK based on asymptomatic adolescents. In Lenke 1 AIS patients, post-op TK in 87.5% of patients matched the predictive value, indicating that the new formula can be considered as a reference when making a surgery strategy. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Sagittal rebalancing of a fixated lumbar hypolordosis (kyphosis) is very important to gain satisfactory results. To correct a misalignment vertebral column resection or pedicle subtraction osteotomies are favored, disregarding the relatively high complication rates. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and safety of a new modified transforaminal lumbar fusion technique as an alternative. <h4>Methods:</h4> We conducted a retrospective review (06/2011-06/2015) of a prospective database at an University hospital. Inclusion criteria were adult patients with a fixated lumbar hypolordosis and the need of monosegmental correction of more than 10\u00b0 with an mTLIF. Exclusion criteria consisted of minor aged patients and polysegmental corrections. Study parameters were the perioperative complications and the achieved postsurgical lordosis. The follow up period was 6 months. <h4>Results:</h4> A total of 11 patients could be included. The mean segmental lordosis was -2.3\u00b0 \u00b1 12.4\u00b0 (range -22\u00b0 to 14\u00b0) preoperative and 15.5\u00b0 \u00b1 10.5\u00b0 (range 0\u00b0 to 29\u00b0) postoperative. The degree of correction was 17\u00b0 \u00b1 5.7\u00b0 in mean per treated segment (range 12\u00b0 to 29\u00b0). No neurologic or vascular complications occurred. No substantial loss of correction or implant failure was noted during the 6-month follow-up. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The modified transforaminal lumbar fusion technique is a safe method to correct a fixated lumbar kyphosis. The potential of segmental correction is comparable to pedicle subtraction osteotomies but sparing potentially healthy segments. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Proximal junction kyphosis (PJK) and proximal junctional failure are common complications of surgical treatment for adult spinal deformity. The incidence of PJK/PJF is reported at 20-40%; of these cases, about 50% will undergo revision surgery for PJK. Revision surgery for PJK/PJF approximately doubles the cost of surgical treatment for ASD and is estimated at 77\\u2009432 US dollars per revision surgery. Risk factors contributing to PJK have been extensively investigated. Both patient specific and modifiable risk factors have been identified. Important modifiable risk factors include implant design, construct design, degree of correction, disruptions of posterior elements, and combined anterior/posterior procedures. Despite known, construct specific, modifiable risk factors, the optimal construct design to prevent PJK remains elusive. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> A total of 19 patients (3 men and 16 women) underwent posterior fusion using a unique, staggered technique for pedicle screw-rod construct, whereby the upper instrumented vertebra was varied by either 1 or 2 levels from the contralateral pedicle screw-rod construct. Patients were included if they were older than 18 years old and were undergoing either primary or revision surgery for ASD. Patients with previous surgery for ASD, including those with previous development of PJK were not excluded. Patients undergoing fixation for acute trauma, compression fracture, and neoplastic deformity were excluded. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 28 months. The primary outcome measure was defined as re-operation rate due to proximal junctional kyphosis. Secondary measures included the rate of complications such as PJK not requiring revision, pseudoarthrosis formation, instrumentation failure, infection, and upper instrumentation pain. <h4>Results:</h4> One patient required revision due to PJK. In this patient, PJK occurred concomitantly with infection and upper instrumentation failure at 23 months post-operatively. One additional patient developed radiographically significant PJK but remains clinically asymptomatic. Two additional patients required reoperation for infection. Minor complications included superficial wound infection (1 patient), temporary motor deficit (2 patients), and upper instrumentation pain (2 patients). The average number of instrumented levels was 9.74 (range 5 to 15). On average, kyphosis at the proximal instrumented vertebrae increased 4.26 degrees (range -8 to 24). 2 patients were lost to follow up. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Asymmetric screw rod fixation is a safe technique with the potential to decrease proximal junctional kyphosis, proximal junctional failure, and therefore, revision spine surgery for adult spinal deformity. <h4>Introduction:</h4> to study the effect of the parameters of the local sagittal balance of the cervical spine on the quality of life of patients operated on for degenerative-dystrophic disease. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> From 2014 till 2017 56 patients with lumbar spine scoliosis were operated in the Federal Neurosurgical Center (50 men and 50 women). The patients\u2019 age was 49,8 \u00b1 9,8 years. The mean follow-up period was 23.6 \u00b1 12.4 months. Patients\u2019 neurological status evaluation was performed according to Japanese Orthopedic Association 1994 (JOA). The severity of the pain syndrome was assessed by a visual analogue pain scale (VAS). To assess the quality of life, the Neck Disability Index (NDI) questionnaire was used (H. Veron, J. Mior, 1989) according to the scale of The Short Form-36 (SF36). Neuroimaging methods included MRI, MSCT and X-ray. According to the radiographs, the assessment of the Sagittal vertical axis (SVA) C2-C7, the SVA center gravity of the head (CGH) -C7, the Cobb angle C2-C7, the Spino-cranial angle (SCA), the Thoracic inlet angle (TIA) neck tilt NT), T1 slope, C7 slope, Cranial incidence (CI), Cranial slope (CS), Cranial tilt (CT). <h4>Results:</h4> During the follow-up period, a positive correlation was found between C7 Slope and NDI (r = 0.31, p = 0.02). Perhaps a negative relationship between C7 Slope and SF36-PH (r = -0.27, p = 0.06). Positive correlation (on the verge of significance) between SVA C2-C7 and NDI (r = 0.24, p = 0.08). The value of the NDI questionnaire (p = 0.03) is worse in the group of patients with SVA C2-C7 more than 40\\u2009mm. In the group with \u201cfront\u201d surgery, more than 75% of patients have SVA CGH-C7 less than 40\\u2009mm, in the \u201cback\u201d - more than 40\\u2009mm in all patients (p = 0.01). The balance after surgery is compensated in the most patients in the group of ventral surgery. Meanwhile, SVA CGH-C7 and clinical studies have not been detected, although SVA CGH-C7 and C2-7 strongly correlate (SVA CGH-C7 and SVA C2-7 (p = 0.000)). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The parameters of C7 slope, SVA C2-C7 of the local sagittal balance statistically significantly affect the patient\u2019s quality of life (according to NDI, SF-36). A statistically significant threshold for SVA C2-C7 for decompensating the sagittal balance was 40\\u2009mm. In patients after ventral surgery SVA CGH-C7 is reliably below 40\\u2009mm, however, no statistically significant correlation was found with clinical outcomes. <h4>Introduction:</h4> To identify perioperative complications in the elderly undergoing single-level posterolateral fusion versus interbody fusion for spondylolisthesis. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> Retrospective data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database for the years 2012 \u2013 2014 were used to evaluate 30\\u2009day outcomes. Adult patients who underwent single-level posterolateral fusion (PLF) and posterolateral interbody fusion (PLIF) for spondylolisthesis were identified. Outcomes were compared between current smokers (within one year of surgery) and non-smokers. <h4>Results:</h4> Between 2012 and 2014, 1,688 patients who underwent single-level PLF or PLIF for spondylolisthesis were identified from the ACS-NSQIP database. Among these, a total of 1,599 patients between the ages of 45 \u2013 79 (94.7%) and 89 patients (5.3%) were 80 years or older. In the elderly group, there were 33 patients who underwent PLIF (37.1%). Overall, there were no significant differences in demographics or comorbidities between the PLF and PLIF groups. However, operative time was significantly longer for elderly patients who underwent PLIF vs PLF (3.0 \u00b1 1.3 vs. 2.4 \u00b1 1.0 hours, p = 0.036). In terms of 30-day outcomes, elderly patients who underwent PLIF had a higher complication rate (12.1% vs. 5.4%), though this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.416). Similarly, readmission (6.1% vs. 5.4%, p = 1.00) and reoperation (3.0% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.371) rates were higher for PLIF vs PLF patients without reaching significance. Compared to middle-age patients, patients in the elderly group were significantly more likely to be hypertensive (80.9% vs. 59.8%, p < 0.001) and dependent (9.0% vs. 2.1%, p < 0.001) compared to younger patients. Similarly, a significantly higher proportion of patients in the elderly group were more likely to be ASA Class 3 \u2013 4 compared to the younger group (67.4% vs. 47.4%, p = 0.002). On the other hand, middle-age patients were more likely to be smokers compared patients 80 years or older (16.8% vs. 3.4%, p < 0.001. In terms of operative parameters, middle-age patients were more likely to undergo interbody fusion (63.9% vs. 37.1%, p < 0.001) but also longer operative times (3.1 \u00b1 1.4 hours vs. 2.7 \u00b1 1.2 hours, p < 0.001). Length of stay was longer for elderly patients compared to younger patients (4.6 \u00b1 4.2 days vs. 3.3 \u00b1 2.8 days, p = 0.005). Lastly, perioperative complication (3.6% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.873), readmission (4.8% vs. 4.0%, p = 0.454), and reoperation (2.8% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.483) rates were not significantly different between the PLIF and PLF groups, respectively for patients aged 45 to 79. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Octogenarians, although make up a smaller percentage of operative patients, are not at a higher rate of complication compared to their younger counterparts. The findings of this study may help spine surgeons and patients for preoperative risk stratification and perioperative expectations. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Due to the significant shortage of Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP-2) in Europe at the beginning of 2016, a new technique was developed to combine the osteoconductive, osteogenic and osteoinductive properties of bone grafts. Prior to 2016, a combination of fresh frozen femoral head (FFFH) (osteoconductive) and BMP-2 (osteoinductive) was used inside the fusion cage, with excellent results. The technique involved inserting BMP-2 into two drill holes inside the FFFH, a technique adopted from Gold Coast Spine, Australia. We describe a new technique of replacing the BMP-2 with a core of cancellous iliac crest bone autograft, obtained using a cannulated core biopsy needle. Inserting this autologous cancellous bone core inside a drilled tunnel in the cancellous FFFH allograft added osteogenic and osteoinductive properties to the structural osteoconductive FFFH graft. The fusion was assessed using fine cut CT scan. To our knowledge this technique has not been described before. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> This is a prospective review of 50 consecutive patients (total 53 levels fused) who underwent Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (ALIF) between 2016-2017. All patients had a routine fine cut CT scan at 4-5 months post-operatively to assess for fusion. The CT scan was reviewed by a consultant radiologist to assess the presence of fusion. All patients had ALIF at L4/5 and/or L5/S1 using a Brantigan\u00ae cage and Aegis\u00ae plate (Depuy-Synthes). A combination of FFFH allograft and iliac crest core autograft were used. Two blocks of cancellous FFFH allograft were cut to the size of the graft windows using an electric saw. A core of cancellous iliac crest bone was inserted through a drill hole in the middle of each block of FFFH. The autograft was obtained from the left iliac crest through a stab incision in the skin. Once the 10 gauge Stryker\u00ae biopsy needle was through the cortical bone, the stylet was removed and the needle advanced 4-5\\u2009cm, continuously rotating the needle. <h4>Results:</h4> 50 consecutive patients who underwent ALIF procedures for degenerative conditions were included. There were 32 females. The mean age was 44.2 (33.6-70.3) years. 29 patients had surgery at L5/S1, 18 patients at L4/5 and 3\\u2009at L4/5 and L5/S1. 11 patients had surgery for spondylolisthesis, 14 for recurrent disc prolapse, 20 for neuroforaminal stenosis due to significant loss of disc height, and 5 for DDD. There was radiological fusion in 49 patients (52 levels) (98%), and non-union in one. The patient who had radiological non-union was a 42 year old female, non-smoker, and had surgery for DDD. There were no complications at the donor site (pain or infection). There was no VTE, and no intra-operative complications. The average blood loss was 90 mls (40-160 mls). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Combining iliac crest cancellous bone autograft, obtained through a minimally invasive technique, with cancellous allograft is effective with good union rate (98%), without complications from the donor site. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Indocyanine green (ICG) videoangiography is a new technique that allows for real-time evaluation of blood flow in the aneurysm and vessels. Intra-operative indocyanine green (ICG) videoangiography is a useful addition to cerebrovascular neurosurgery. We evaluate the usefulness and limitation of ICG videoangiography during the cervical posterior fixation to evaluate the patency of the vertebral artery in the cases with high risk of VA injury. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> Twenty-three patients (15 female, 8 male; mean age, 54.4 years) were evaluated. Near infrared ICG angiography was applied after the posterior screw fixation in the cases of high riding VA at the level of C2 vertebra, V3 segment anomaly and the situation of the VA injury was suspected during the surgical procedure. <h4>Results:</h4> ICG videoangiography is useful in different types of upper cervical posterior surgery. This technique is useful to evaluate the VA patency after screw instrumentation especially in the cases of the VA anomaly and high riding VA. And it is useful to identify the vessel patency after the inevitable VA management during the procedure. Overall, the procedure interrupted the surgical procedure for less than 5 minutes. One case of adverse skin reaction to the dye was encountered due to the dye leakage outside the vessel during the injection. ICG videoangiography has some limitations such as its inability to be viewed outside of the observed plane of illumination with infrared light and inconsistent complete washout, making repeated viewing sometimes difficult in structures surrounded by thick and excessive tissue. Quantitative evaluation of vessel flow is not possible with ICG videoangiography. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> ICG angiography could be a simple intraoperative evaluating tool with which the patency of the extracranial vertebral artery can be assessed. Compared with digital subtraction angiography, ICG angiography requires less time, personnel, and equipment, is safer, and can resolve smaller vessels, but is limited by the surgeon\u2019s viewing angle and the depth of penetration of the infrared light. Even though it is necessary to expose the VA above the C1 arch or lateral to the C1 lateral mass to identify the ICG flow in the cases of CVJ surgery, it can be a useful tool to verify the patency of the possibly damaged VA during the screw placement. Unlike ultrasound technology, this technique is a hands-off method that can inform the surgeon about the flow patency of the extracranial vertebral artery. <h4>Introduction:</h4> The incidence of serious cervical spine injuries is low but associated rates of death and disability are high. In both British and Chinese studies, cervical spine is the most commonly affected region among traumatic spinal cord injuries (Lenehan, 2012). Cervical spinal cord injury is a devastating event for the patient and family. Mortality associated with cervical spine fractures is less studied. This deficiency in the literature contributes to a lack of consensus on the optimal treatment of cervical fractures (Jackson, 2005). <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> All patients admitted at Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital (Negros Occidental, Philippines), Dr. Pablo O. Torre Memorial Hospital (Negros Occidental, Philippines), and Silliman Medical Center (Negros Oriental, Philippines), from January 2008 to December 2012 with cervical SCI secondary to trauma are included in the study. Charts of patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were collected. Patients were categorized according to age group. After collection of data it was double entered in Excel file, and was analyzed using SPSS (version 16\u00b70) software. <h4>Results:</h4> The study group comprised of 51 males (92.7%), and 4 females (7.3%). Patients\u2019 age were from 15 to 76 years old, with mean age of 43.67 years ( \u00b1 16.9, SD). Common cause of injury in 27 patients was fall (49.1%), followed by vehicular accident sustained by 25 patients (45.5%), and axial loading in remaining 3 (5.5%). Incomplete quadriplegia was sustained by 32 patients (58.2%), and complete quadriplegia (Frankel A) in the remaining 23 patients (41.8%). Eleven patients died in their hospital stay (20%), most had complete quadriplegia- Frankel A (n = 10; 43.5%), compared to incomplete quadriplegia (n = 1; 3.1%). Statistical analysis showed no significance between sexes (LRT = 0.064, df = 1, p = 0.8), as well as the cause of injury (x2 = 0.833, df = 2, p = 0.659) for mortality of the patient. Analysis however, showed a significant relationship of the extent of paralysis and mortality (x2 = 11.214, df = 1, p-0.001), as only 1 out of 31 patients with incomplete quadriplegia (3.1%) eventually expired, compared to 10 of 23 (43.5%) in completely quadriplegic patients. Last normal motor and sensory level did not show a significant statistical relationship to mortality (LR = 8.17, df = 6, p = 0.226). Radiographic abnormality, presence of spinal shock on admission, and patient\u2019s age, showed no statistical significance to the mortality of the patient. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> This study showed that males of older adult group usually sustained cervical spinal cord injury either due to fall, or motor vehicular accident, with almost half having fracture-dislocation. Statistical analyses showed no significant relationship of age, sex, level of injury, and mechanism of injury to mortality. There is however a statistically significant relationship of extent of injury, particularly Frankel A, to eventual mortality of the patient. Surgical procedure can be a positive predictor for survival in cervical SCI patients. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Scoliosis has long been measured in the 2D AP plane using the Cobb angle, which does not account for axial vertebral rotation (VR). In the past, the Stagnara lateral has been used in attempt to correct for VR. To date, no similar view has been described for the AP plane. 3D CT imaging may allow for more accurate measurement of Cobb angles by compensating for axial VR. We hypothesized that Cobb angles obtained from the rotationally compensated images differ significantly from those on traditional AP radiograph. <h4>Methods:</h4> In this retrospective study, standard AP, lateral, and bending radiographs of 23 patients age 10-17 with AIS were obtained. Using multi-planar 3D CT, the coronal plane was reconstructed within the plane of the vertebral axis to form a rotationally compensated 3D CT image (RC-3DCT). The following measurements were made on both imaging modalities: PT, MT, TL/L curve, coronal balance, T/L-AVT, T/L-AVR, thoracic kyphosis, and sagittal balance. <h4>Results:</h4> The mean MT curve was found to be 52.50\u00b0 on AP radiograph vs. 45.36\u00b0 on RC-3DCT (P = 0.011). In 3 patients (13.04%), rotational compensation altered the end vertebra of the major curve by at least 1 level. The mean TL curve obtained on radiograph, was significantly larger than that of RC-3DCT (42.93 vs. 34.32\u00b0; P = 0.00\\u2009210). AP films overstated coronal balance by over 50% when compared to RC-3DCT (P = 0.0320). Mean T-AVT was measured to be 37.04\\u2009mm on conventional films and 29.8\\u2009mm on RC-3DCT (P = 0.028). RC-3DCT L-AVT was significantly smaller than that of standard films (P = 0.034). Mean T-AVR on standing film was 18.9 \u00b1 11.2\u00b0. The mean thoracic kyphosis greatly differed between the two modalities: 33.69\u00b0on radiograph vs. 20.04\u00b0 on RC-3DCT (P = 2.16x10-5). <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Measurements traditionally made on AP radiograph to evaluate scoliosis may be fundamentally inaccurate due to VR. Our data suggests that axial rotation of a patient 19\u00b0 per Nash\u2013Moe grade with respect to the coronal plane may adequately compensate for the rotational component of deformity without the need for CT. Additionally, rotational compensation may yield end vertebrae levels different from those obtained traditionally. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Spondylodiscitis, a term encompassing vertebral osteomyelitis, spondylitis and discitis, is the main manifestation of haematogenous osteomyelitis in patients aged over 50 years. Staphylococcus aureus is the predominant pathogen, accounting for about half of non-tuberculous cases. Diagnosis is difficult and often delayed or missed due to the rarity of the disease, particularly in the cervical spine. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> We present the case of a 57 year old female patient whose medical history was significant for nodal skin lesions encompassing her arms and forearms, her presternal region, and her back. Some lesions were encrusted due to previous hemorrhagic blistering from persistent scratching. She suffered from these skin lesions for twenty years, treated them withtopical ointments, and was followed up at dermatologists. She was also referred for allergy testing which proved negative for all common contact, nutritive and inhalational allergens, and so her condition was diagnosed as a neurodermatitis. She presented to the emergency neurological department with axial neck pain referring to the right shoulder and arm, she was non- febrile and with no neurological impairment. She was discharged with a diagnosis of cervicobrachial syndrome and referred to physical therapy and rehabilitation specialist. The next day she developed an increased temperature of 39.7\\u2009oC with rapidly worsening axial neck pain and symptoms of septicaemia and was admitted urgently in a clinic for infectious diseases. Bloodculture was positive for methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and antibiotic therapy with cloxacillin was promptly initiated. Four days later she began manifesting motor deficits in the distribution of myotomes C4 - (strength \u2157), C5 - (\u2157), C6 - (\u2155), C7 - (\u2158), C8 - (\u2158). An emergency MRI of her cervical spine showed an paravertebral abscess in the right C3-C7 region and MRI characteristics of spondylodiscitis of her C5 and C6 vertebral bodies. She was then urgently transferred to our clinic for emergent surgical treatment. We performed a left sided anterior cervical approach, corpectomy of C5 and C6, drainage of the abscess, lavage and reconstruction of the anterior column with a MESH cage filled with autologous trabecular bone from her ipsilateral iliac crest and anterior cervical locking plate fixation from C4 to C7. <h4>Results:</h4> The immediate postoperative period was uneventful. Her neck was immobilized with neck collar. Immediate postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) pain score was 3-4/10 using NSAID only. Rifampicin was added to her anthibiotic regiment immediately postoperatively to prevent biofilm formation along the implant. Drainage was removed on the second postoperative day and her fever subsided. Neurologic improvement was witnessed by the third postoperative day. She was transferred back to the infectious diseases clinic from where she was initially transferred to us for further intravenous antibiotic treatment as per the spondylodiscitis protocol. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Spondylodiscitis can be a rare complication of pyogenic skin infection, including one resulting from neurodermatitis due to breach in skin integrity from persistent scratching. <h4>Introduction:</h4> In the 21st century, there has been a significant increase in attention to the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) as a source of low back pain. Many studies have shown positive outcomes of minimally invasive (MIS) SIJ fusion. The purpose of this study is to examine patient reported outcomes for this procedure in a United States Military Veterans population. Previous studies on other health conditions have suggested differences between normal and veteran populations, with the latter having lower health scores in addition to being predominantly male. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> This study is a retrospective case series of our experience with twenty-one MIS SIJ fusions using triangular ingrown titanium rods in twenty patients at our local Veterans Affairs Medical Center from August 2011 through February 2014. Of our twenty patients, seventeen were male and three were female and they had an average age of 56 years. Surgical indications were based on history, physical exam, and diagnostic sacroiliac joint injections. Primary diagnosis was degenerative sacroiliitis in all cases except one of chronic SIJ infection. Patient reported outcomes (numeric pain scores and Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]) were collected pre and post operatively with final outcomes at greater than two years for all patients. Final follow up was at an average of 3.3 years and was completed for 18/20 patients. <h4>Results:</h4> At final follow up, ODI improved from 57.9 pre-operatively to 44.3 (p = 0.02) at final follow up. Signifiant improvement was seen by three months post operatively and this was maintained through final follow up. The VAS score for back pain improved from 6.7 to 5.8\\u2009at final follow up. The VAS score showed regression after the first year of follow up. Mean operative time was 96 minutes (range 53-244). Mean blood loss was an average of 80\\u2009cc (range 25-350). Mean hospital stay was an average of 1.5 days (range 1-4) with all but one patient discharging home from the hospital. There was one complication noted in our series which was a return to OR secondary to pseudoarthrosis. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion is an effective treatment of low back pain in the right patient. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Minimally Invasive Lumbar Interbody Fusion is a retroperitoneal approach which uses corridor between psoas and great vessels. Here we have retrospectively analyzed its early radiological & clinical outcomes in degenerative lumbar spine disease. <h4>Methods:</h4> OLIF was carried out in 49 segments of 38 patients from May 2016 to August 2017. Patients with degenerative lumbar spine disease were included whereas patients with infection, trauma, lumbar disc prolapse, severe bony canal stenosis, lysthesis of grade 3 or more were excluded. 34 patients (45 segments) were included in this study. All patients were operated from left side. 40 segments had posterior percutaneous and 5 segments had anterior fixation. Auto graft was used in 21 patients (31 segments) and artificial bone graft was used in 13 patients (14 segments). Indirect decompression by distraction was achieved in all patients. Neuromonitioring was not used. Clinical assessment was done according to modified Macnab\u2019s criteria. Radiological assessment was done on lateral radiographs of lumbosacral spine & MRI. Percentage improvement in foraminal height, disc height, reduction of lysthesis & increase in segmental lordosis were measured on radiographs and increase in overall area of spinal canal was evaluated on MRI scans. <h4>Results:</h4> Out of 34 patients 11 were male and 23 were female. Average age was 63 years. Single segment fusion was done in 24, 2 segment fusion in 9 and 3 segment fusion was done in 1 patient. Average follow up was 5 months. By modified Macnab\u2019s criteria, 24 patients (70.59%) had excellent, 8 patients (23.53%) had good & 2 patients (5.88%) had fair outcomes. None required direct decompression. Per operative complications included rupture of iliolumbar vein in 1(2.94%), breach of peritoneum and fracture of superior endplate of inferior vertebrae in 2 (5.88%) patients. All patients had postoperative graft site pain in which autograft was taken. Graft site fracture occurred in 2 (5.88%) patients which got healed within 3 weeks. Ipsilateral psoas weakness/ pain was seen in 11 (32.35%) patients which got resolved within 3 weeks. 1 (2.94%) patient had superficial /deep infection. 6 (17.64%) had contralateral radiculopathy with motor deficit in 1 patient. 3(8.82%) of them required direct decompression. Conservatively managed patients recovered partial to fully within 1\\u2009month. 1(2.94%) patient had numbness in area distribution of left genitofemoral nerve. Overall complication rate was 40.12%. On radiological assessment, overall improvement in foraminal height was 20.78%, disc height improved by 97.32%, average lysthesis reduction was 7.1%, increase in segmental lordosis was 3.16o.36 segments were studied on T2\\u2009W MRI axial scans. Overall improvement in spinal canal area was 46.54%. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Early clinical outcomes of this study have shown excellent to good results & also significant increase in foraminal height, disc height, segmental lordosis, spinal canal area and reduction of listhesis on radiological assessment with low rate of irreversible complications. <h4>Introduction:</h4> A retrospective and prospective analysis of the surgical treatment and results of 118 patients with benign and malignant craniocervical, atlantoaxial and high cervical lesions operated during 60 \u2013 month period (2011-2016) at our Department was performed. The aim of the analysis was to assess the factors affecting dorsal fusion as correction of craniocervical and high cervical instability. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> We analyzed 84 patients with traumatic lesions, 10 patients with inflammatory lesions, 8 patients with degenerative instability, and 16 patients with high cervical tumors. <h4>Results:</h4> In 118 patients we performed 132 operations. We used posterior cervical, and craniocervical median approach. Because of craniocervical/cervical instability we made posterior screw fixation in all of 118 patients. In order to improve screw placement accuracy we performed intraoperative O-Arm in 102 cases. The operative duration was 2.15\\u2009h. in O-Arm operations and 4.35\\u2009h in C-arm operation. The blood loss was 300\\u2009ml in O-Arm and 550\\u2009ml in C-Arm procedures. The mean screw length in C1/C2 vertebras was 30\\u2009mm in O- Arm procedures and 24\\u2009mm in C-Arm procedures. The most common operative complications were: CSF leak \u2013 in 2 cases, postoperative infection \u2013 in 5 cases, screw misplacement - in 2 cases (in C- Arm procedures) without early operative mortality. The 12-monts follow-up showed good recovery in 79 patients, moderate disabling \u2013 25 patients, severe disabling \u2013 5 patients, vegetative state \u2013 4 patients, death 5 patients with malignant lesions. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Early correction of craniocervical and high cervical instability facilitated neurological recovery by preserving the existent neurological function. Using of O-Arm increase operative screw placement accuracy, and preserve intraoperative nerve and vertebral artery injury. Recently because of the improvement of neuroimaging techniques, operative approaches, surgical techniques and neurointensive care the results of treatment of these lesions are optimal. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Although pedicle screws have been regarded as the first-line choice for fixation of C7, they may require radiographic or fluoroscopic guidance, take time for placement, and have a potential risk of neurovascular complications. Given such limitations, C7 laminar screw might serve as a viable alternative. However, while laminar screws are widely used for C2 fixation, reports on the clinical experience of C7 laminar screws are quite limited. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy and safety of C7 laminar screw placement with a free-hand technique. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> All patients who underwent posterior cervical fixation with C7 laminar screws by the last author were chosen. All screws were placed with a free-hand technique without radiographic or fluoroscopic guidance. The operating time for each screw placement was approximately 1-2 minutes. Clinical information and radiologic data of the patients were analyzed. Using postoperative CT scans, which were taken in all patients, the accuracy of screw placement was evaluated by two orthopedic surgeons by assessing the direction (dorsal versus ventral) and degree of laminar cortical breach. <h4>Results:</h4> Forty-three consecutive patients were enrolled. There were 26 males and 17 females, and the age averaged 59 years (range, 14-82). A total of 61 C7 laminar screws were used: twenty-five patients underwent unilateral C7 laminar screw fixation, and eighteen patients underwent bilateral fixation (Figs 1 and 2). All the laminar screws were 3.5\\u2009mm in diameter and 20 to 26\\u2009mm in length (3 20-mm, 13 22-mm, 38 24-mm, and 7 26-mm screws). Of the 61 screws, 14 screws (23%) breached the laminar cortical wall, including 3 dorsal and 11 ventral breaches. Of those 14 screws, 11 screws (18%) breached by less than 50% of screw diameter and 3 screws (5%) breached by more than 50% but less than 100% of screw diameter. Nine screws were one of the screws placed bilaterally, and 5 screws were unilaterally placed. No intraoperative neurovascular injury was observed, and none of the screws with cortical breaches resulted in worsening of neurologic symptoms. None of the patients required reoperation for any reason. Over the follow-up period of 20 months, mechanical failure such as loosening or fractures of screw-rod system has not been observed. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> To our knowledge, this is the largest clinical study ever performed on C7 laminar screw fixation. Although laminar cortical breach was common (25%) with our free-hand technique, most were trivial and none had clinically relevant neurovascular complications nor mechanical failures. Therefore, C7 laminar screws, which can be placed quickly and easily without the need of radiographic or fluoroscopic guidance, may provide a valuable alternative to pedicle screws for C7 fixation in terms of efficacy and safety. However, long-term outcomes, including fusion status, remains to be evaluated with further follow-up. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Severe pediatric deformity can be extremely challenging to treat due to difficulties with instrumentation placement in small patients, stress on implants due to correction of severe deformities, and use of three column osteotomies. This study analyzed the instrumentation and fusion related complications in complex spine deformity surgical cases. Hypotheses: pediatric patients with severe spinal deformities treated surgically have a high rate of revision surgery for instrument and fusion related complications. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> This was a prospective observational multi center cohort of pediatric patients having surgical treatment for severe spinal deformity ( > 100\u00b0 or planned VCR). 176 patients with severe complex spinal deformity were included from a prospective database with a min. 2 year follow-up. Complications with or without revision due to pseudoarthrosis, instrumentation failure, infection requiring instrumentation removal and progression of deformity were all analyzed. <h4>Results:</h4> 176 patients out of 313 pts reached a minimum of 2 years follow up. 21 patients (12%) had complications associated with the instrumentation. 15 patients (9%) required 16 revision surgeries because of instrumentation failure. 6 patients (3%) had complications but did not require any revisions. The 16 revision surgeries included 7 (43%) with loss of fixation. The average time for the revision surgery was 13 months (0-28) after the index surgery. Only one patient had 2 revisions. 4 patients were revised for pseudarthrosis at an average of 23 months (17-35). 2 patients (13%) had revisions for prominent instrumentation (both at 27 mos postop), 2 (13%) for infection (19 and 36 months respectively), and one patient had revision surgery for deformity progression at 2 months postoperatively. The patients that did not have revision surgeries included 2 with prominent implants both found at 18 months postop, 2 with progressive deformity/PJK at 18 months average (14-22), and 2 had loss of fixation at 6 months (0-12). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Pediatric patients with severe spinal deformity are high risk for revision surgeries at 12% rate within 2 years. The average time for revision surgery was 19 months postoperatively. These patients require close follow-up and will require continued follow-up after 2 years. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Cervical spinal cord injury is a devastating consequence of high energy trauma and despite of advances in emergency care of quadriplegia patients it is associated with high in-hospital mortality. We conducted systematic review of current literature to identify the predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients with cervical spinal cord injury. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> Two independent reviewers conducted systematic review of English literature between period January 2000 and May 2017 for articles reporting predictors of in-hospital mortality after traumatic spinal cord injuries. Review was conducted according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines using a PRISMA checklist. Inclusion criteria were studies with more than 50 adult patients (18 years or older) with traumatic spinal cord injury and reporting predictors of mortality. We included those predictors when at least two studies were available for those predictors. The method of best evidence synthesis for observational studies were used to analyse the quality of each studies and for synthesis of final evidence. <h4>Results:</h4> The search strategy resulted in 8 articles. Three studies were rated as \u2018high quality\u2019, one study as \u2018moderate quality\u2019 and four as \u2018low quality\u2019. Increasing age, higher cervical level, early surgical decompression, higher ASIA grade at presentation, ventilatory requirements and cardiovascular stability are all observed to be associated with high in-hospital mortality in this patient population. Increasing age and longer ventilatory support were consistently found to be associated with high in-hospital mortality with moderate grade of evidence. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Whilst there is no conclusive strong evidence of the predictors for in-hospital mortality following cervical spinal cord injury, special attention should be paid to the above observed predictors. Further prospective studies are warranted in large samples that can delineate the most effective predictor or combination scheme of predictors to ultimately aid clinicians risk stratify the patients and improve the survival outcome. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Surgery in neurological deficit due to delayed collapse of non-healing osteoporotic fractures is often met with complication due to associated co-morbidity and potential of instrumentation failure. Management of OFND is controversial. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> 40 patients with neurological deficit due to delayed osteoporotic vertebral collapse managed by posterior surgery (decompression + instrumentation + transpedicular bone graft) with minimum 2 years follow up included. Demographic data (age, sex, mode of injury, severity of osteoporosis, duration of delay in presentation); clinical parameters [Visual Analogous score (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Frankel grade], radiological parameters (local kyphosis), surgical variables (blood loss, surgery duration, intra-operative problems) recorded. Neurological worsening /improvement, complications, implant loosening /failures were noted. <h4>Results:</h4> Significant improvement noted in VAS (pre-op 8.20 \u00b1 0.65/post-op 4.1 \u00b1 0.64), ODI (Pre op 76.54 \u00b1 6.96/Post op 30.5 \u00b1 6.56). Complete neurological recovery noted in 37 patients (Frankel grade E), 3 patients remained non ambulatory (Frankel grade C). Significant improvement noted in local kyphosis angle (pre op = 21.80 \u00b1 2.70; post op 11.40 \u00b1 1.80), with 10% loss of correction (2.5+/-0.90) at final follow up. Symptomatic implant failure was noted in 2 patients and proximal junctional failure in 1 patient requiring revision. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> OFND can be managed with single posterior surgery (decompression + instrumentation+ transpedicular bone-graft) with significant improvement in neurology and functional scores of patient. Aggressive kyphosis correction often not required and significant correction of kyphosis is noticed due to positioning alone. Transpedicular grafting is safe and simple alternative to cement augmentation or anterior surgery for collapsed vertebrae. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Surgical and clinical outcomes were reviewed to determine the biological behavior and prognostic factors of atypical spinal meningioma. Because of the scarcity of atypical meningioma, there is a lack of research on this type of tumor and malignant transformation. <h4>Methods:</h4> We retrospectively reviewed the data from all patients on whom we performed spinal cord tumor removal between 1994 and 2016. Seventeen patients were pathologically proved to have atypical meningioma. Surgical extent and disease progression were established by the surgeon according to operative findings, postoperative MRI, and outpatient department (OPD) follow-up. <h4>Results:</h4> Seventeen patients were included in the analysis, 12 (70%) of whom had tumors in the thoracic region, 4 (24%) of whom had tumors in the cervical region, and 1 (6%) of whom had tumors in the sacral region. Complete resection was achieved in 15 (88%) patients, and subtotal resection was performed in 2 (12%) patients. 4 (24%) patients had metastatic meningioma from brain. Among 4 patients, 3 patients administered radiotherapy after surgery as adjuvant radiotherapy. One patient who underwent surgery for anaplastic meningioma in the brain recurred, and underwent three operations in the spine. The 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 88.3%, while the 5- and 10-year recurrence-free survival rates were 83% and 52%, respectively. Additionally the mean Ki-67 index differed significantly between patients who did and did not develop recurrence (43% vs. 14%; p = 0.001). <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Total surgical resection should be considered as a primary treatment modality for individuals with atypical spinal meningioma and if subtotal resection was performed, adjuvant radiotherapy is necessary.', 'pubYear': '2018', 'doi': '<NO

Your mission is to retrieve precise, relationship-rich information that can be directly incorporated into knowledge graphs to drive hypothesis generation.\n\n## SEARCH STRATEGY OPTIMIZATION\nWhen given a concept or entity in rheumatology:\n\n1. Identify the optimal search approach:\n   - For molecular mechanisms: Search PubMed, Nature, Cell, and bioRxiv with \"[concept] signaling pathway rheumatology\"\n   - For clinical correlations: Search NEJM, Lancet, BMJ with \"[concept] clinical outcomes autoimmune\"\n   - For emerging research: Search bioRxiv, medRxiv with \"[concept] novel mechanism 2023\"\n   - For established relationships: Use query_hetionet to find known entity connections\n\n2. Construct multi-source search queries:\n   - Primary sources: Always include PubMed (highest quality peer-reviewed content)\n   - Secondary sources: Select 2-3 domain-specific sources based on the query type:\n     * Molecular/cellular focus \u2192 Cell, Nature, Science\n     * Clinical/therapeutic focus \u2192 NEJM, Lancet, BMJ\n     * Methods/technologies focus \u2192 bioRxiv, PLOS, Frontiers\n   - Use advanced query formatting with Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)\n   - Add precise modifiers: \"mechanism\", \"pathway\", \"interaction\", \"regulates\", \"inhibits\"\n\n3. Time-relevance optimization:\n   - For established concepts: Include older literature (no time restriction)\n   - For emerging concepts: Add recency modifiers (\"last 2 years\", \"since 2021\")\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS\n\n1. Extract only relationship-focused information:\n   - Entity-relationship-entity patterns (e.g., \"TNF-\u03b1 activates NF-\u03baB pathway\")\n   - Quantitative correlations with statistical significance (e.g., \"IL-6 levels correlated with disease activity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n   - Mechanistic statements with directionality (e.g., \"downstream inhibition of JAK1/2 decreased STAT3 phosphorylation by 64%\")\n   - Contradictory findings across different sources (e.g., \"While Smith et al. reported increased expression, Chen et al. found no significant change\")\n\n2. Format extracted information for knowledge graph integration:\n   - Subject-predicate-object structures (\"Entity A \u2192 relationship \u2192 Entity B\")\n   - Direction and nature of relationships (activates, inhibits, upregulates, binds, etc.)\n   - Strength of evidence (established, emerging, contradicted, hypothesized)\n   - Source quality assessment (peer-reviewed journal, impact factor, citation count)\n\n3. Condensed source referencing:\n   - Format: [First Author et al., Journal abbreviation, Year] for each key finding\n   - DOI or PMID inclusion for all peer-reviewed sources\n   - Preprint server ID for non-peer-reviewed content\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\n1. Content structure:\n   - Begin with 1-2 sentence high-level summary of findings\n   - List 3-5 most significant relationships with explicit entity-relationship-entity structure\n   - Group contradictory or complementary findings together\n   - End with most promising areas for further investigation\n\n2. Justification:\n   - Explain why these specific relationships are most relevant for knowledge graph construction\n   - Note any gaps or uncertainties that might influence hypothesis generation\n   - Highlight cross-validation across multiple sources\n\nRemember: Your output will directly feed into knowledge graph construction and ontology enrichment. Focus exclusively on extracting clear, evidence-based relationships between entities that can be represented as graph edges, with properties that capture the nature and directionality of these relationships.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Contextual Query Construction:\n   - When transferring to each agent, provide context-rich guidance:\n     * Specify exactly what information you need about the entity/relationship\n     * Provide relevant context from the subgraph that might inform the search\n     * Explain how this information will help enrich the knowledge graph\n     * Set expectations for the type of relationships to focus on\n\n4. Multi-perspective Integration:\n   - After receiving information from specialist agents, integrate their findings:\n     * Reconcile potentially contradictory information\n     * Identify complementary information across different sources\n     * Recognize emergent patterns not visible in any single source\n     * Synthesize a coherent understanding of mechanisms and relationships\n\n## HANDOFF OPTIMIZATION\n\nUse each specialized agent strategically based on their unique strengths:\n\n1. PubMed Agent (peer-reviewed literature expert):\n   - Use for: Established mechanisms, validated pathways, clinical correlations\n   - Best when: Seeking high-quality evidence from peer-reviewed sources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for validated molecular interactions between TNF-alpha and IL-6 signaling in rheumatoid arthritis synovium, focusing on mechanisms supported by multiple studies.\"\n\n2. BioRxiv Agent (preprint specialist):\n   - Use for: Emerging concepts, cutting-edge methods, newest discoveries\n   - Best when: Established literature is limited or potentially outdated\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the latest preprints on JAK-STAT inhibition in systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly novel mechanisms or targets not yet in peer-reviewed literature.\"\n\n3. Europe PMC Agent (comprehensive literature database):\n   - Use for: Broad coverage across journals, open access content, systematic reviews\n   - Best when: Need comprehensive literature analysis on a specific concept\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for comprehensive reviews and primary research on the role of ACPA in bone erosion mechanisms in rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\n4. Semantic Scholar Agent (citation network specialist):\n   - Use for: Highly influential papers, research impact assessment, interdisciplinary connections\n   - Best when: Need to identify seminal papers or cross-disciplinary insights\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the most highly-cited papers connecting microbiome dysbiosis to autoantibody production in rheumatic diseases, focusing on mechanistic studies.\"\n\n5. Firecrawl Agent (multi-source research tool):\n   - Use for: Broad searches across multiple scientific domains, clinical guidelines\n   - Best when: Topic spans multiple disciplines or resources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search across clinical and basic science resources for evidence connecting environmental triggers to flares in psoriatic arthritis, including both molecular mechanisms and clinical observations.\"\n\n6. Hetionet Agent (knowledge graph specialist):\n   - Use for: Discovering existing network connections, biological pathways, gene-disease associations\n   - Best when: Need to establish known relationships between entities\n   - Example handoff: \"Find all connections between HLA-B27 and inflammatory pathways relevant to axial spondyloarthritis in the existing knowledge graph.\"\n\n## SYNTHESIS APPROACH\n\nAfter collecting information from specialized agents:\n\n1. Create Unstructured Sources (3-5):\n   - Synthesize the most valuable information from all agent responses\n   - Extract clear mechanistic relationships and causal pathways\n   - Include quantitative data supporting key relationships\n   - Organize information to highlight connections between subgraph entities\n   - Maintain proper attribution to original sources\n\n2. Generate Knowledge Graphs (1-2):\n   - Construct coherent extensions to the original subgraph\n   - Focus on mechanistic connections with clear directionality\n   - Include properties that provide clinical and biological context\n   - Ensure nodes and edges are precisely defined with relationship types\n   - Connect new elements logically to the original subgraph entities\n\n## RHEUMATOLOGY DOMAIN FOCUS\n\nPrioritize enrichment related to these key areas:\n- Autoimmune mechanisms (T-cell, B-cell, innate immunity pathways)\n- Inflammatory cascades and cytokine networks\n- Genetic risk factors and their functional consequences\n- Tissue-specific disease manifestations and mechanisms\n- Therapeutic targets and response biomarkers\n- Disease subtypes and precision medicine approaches\n\nYour goal is to produce a comprehensive, mechanistically detailed enrichment of the original subgraph by intelligently orchestrating specialized research agents and synthesizing their findings into a coherent knowledge representation.\n\n## SEARCH AND INFORMATION GATHERING PROTOCOL\n\nWhen your analysis requires external information (e.g., checking novelty, verifying claims, finding supporting/contradicting evidence, exploring alternative mechanisms):\n\n1.  **Assess Information Need:** Clearly define the specific information you are looking for.\n2.  **Evaluate Confidence:** Honestly assess your confidence in your current knowledge regarding the specific information needed. Are you certain about the answer or the best way to find it?\n3.  **Utilize Available Tools/Handoffs:**\n    * If you are **uncertain**, lack specific domain knowledge for the query, require information from a specialized source (like preprints, specific databases, or existing knowledge graphs), or believe a more focused search is necessary, you **MUST** utilize the appropriate tools or handoff agents provided to you (refer to your configured `tools` and `handoffs`).\n    * Do **not** attempt to answer from memory or general knowledge if external verification or specialized search is warranted and available resources exist.\n    * Formulate precise queries or instructions for the tool/agent you are calling. Provide necessary context from your current task.\n4.  **Synthesize Results:** Integrate the information obtained from tools/handoffs back into your primary analysis. Your core responsibility is [mention agent's main function, e.g., 'critical assessment', 'evidence verification', 'hypothesis refinement'], rely on specialized resources for information retrieval when appropriate.\n\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator. Your primary goal in this task is **NOT** just to analyze the provided subgraph, but to **actively enrich and validate it using external, current information obtained via mandatory handoffs to your specialized research agents.** You MUST NOT rely solely on the information present in the initial subgraph or your internal knowledge base for generating the enrichment output.\n\n## SUBGRAPH TO

Your mission is to extract precise, relationship-focused information from the PubMed database that can directly enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## ADVANCED SEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen given a rheumatology-related keyword or concept:\n\n1. Implement a structured search strategy:\n   - Convert general concepts into precise MeSH terms when applicable (e.g., \"rheumatoid arthritis\" \u2192 \"Arthritis, Rheumatoid\"[Mesh])\n   - Add relationship-specific modifiers to focus on mechanisms (e.g., \"pathogenesis\", \"signaling\", \"regulation\", \"mechanism\")\n   - Include methodology terms for higher-quality evidence (e.g., \"randomized controlled trial\", \"meta-analysis\", \"systematic review\")\n   - Apply Boolean operators strategically to narrow results to manageable, high-relevance sets\n   - For genes/proteins: include both official symbols and common alternatives (e.g., \"TNFA\" AND \"TNF-alpha\")\n\n2. Prioritize high-impact sources:\n   - Focus on articles from journals with impact factor >4 when possible\n   - Include both seminal papers (high citation count) and recent publications (last 2-3 years)\n   - Target studies with robust methodology (adequate sample size, appropriate controls, validated techniques)\n   - Look specifically for papers establishing causal relationships rather than mere associations\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen analyzing search results:\n\n1. Focus extraction on specific relationship types:\n   - Regulatory relationships (e.g., \"IL-17 upregulates MMP-3 expression in synovial fibroblasts\")\n   - Signal transduction pathways (e.g., \"MAPK mediates TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation in synoviocytes\")\n   - Genetic influences on disease mechanisms (e.g., \"HLA-DRB1 shared epitope enhances ACPA production\")\n   - Therapeutic mechanisms of action (e.g., \"JAK inhibition blocks STAT3 phosphorylation reducing IL-6 signaling\")\n   - Biomarker correlations with measurable outcomes (e.g., \"Serum CXCL13 levels correlate with synovitis severity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n\n2. Extract quantitative data to support relationships:\n   - Effect sizes with confidence intervals\n   - Sensitivity/specificity values for biomarkers\n   - Dose-response relationships\n   - Temporal dynamics of biological processes\n   - Statistical significance measures (p-values, q-values)\n\n3. Capture methodological context:\n   - Experimental systems used (human patients, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Key technologies employed (RNA-seq, proteomics, CRISPR, etc.)\n   - Validation approaches supporting findings\n   - Limitations explicitly acknowledged by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your response for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. Primary section - Relationship synthesis (60% of content):\n   - Present 3-5 key causal relationships in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Clearly specify directionality (increases/decreases, activates/inhibits)\n   - Include quantitative measures of relationship strength\n   - Group related findings to show pathway connections\n   - Highlight unexpected or novel relationships that could inform hypothesis generation\n\n2. Evidence assessment section (20% of content):\n   - Evaluate consistency across multiple studies\n   - Note contradictory findings with potential explanations\n   - Assess methodological quality of supporting evidence\n   - Identify knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty\n\n3. Source documentation section (20% of content):\n   - For each key finding: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID]\n   - Include impact factor or citation count when relevant\n   - Note study design (e.g., RCT, cohort study, case-control)\n\nYour ultimate goal is to provide the ontology agent with precise, mechanistically detailed information from the highest-quality PubMed sources that can be directly integrated into knowledge graph structures for hypothesis generation.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Your task is to retrieve high-precision information that can be directly incorporated into knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## STRATEGIC SEARCH APPROACH\n\nWhen given a rheumatology-related keyword or concept:\n\n1. Develop an optimized search strategy:\n   - Formulate precise search terms using both specific terminology (e.g., \"synovial fibroblasts\") and standardized MeSH terms when applicable\n   - Incorporate Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to refine search scope (e.g., \"TNF-alpha AND rheumatoid arthritis NOT psoriatic\")\n   - Include relationship-focused terms like \"regulates\", \"activates\", \"inhibits\", \"mediates\", \"correlates with\"\n   - For rare conditions or understudied pathways, broaden search with related mechanisms or model systems\n\n2. Execute search with appropriate filters:\n   - Prioritize recent literature (last 3-5 years) unless seeking established mechanisms\n   - Favor full-text availability for comprehensive extraction of methods and results\n   - Include both research articles and systematic reviews for complementary perspectives\n   - For emerging topics, include preprints to capture cutting-edge findings\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION FOCUS\n\nAfter retrieving Europe PMC results:\n\n1. Prioritize extraction of the following types of information:\n   - Explicit causal relationships between molecular entities (e.g., \"IL-6 upregulates RANKL expression in synoviocytes\")\n   - Quantitative data with statistical significance (e.g., \"Serum levels of CXCL13 were elevated 3.2-fold in RA patients (p<0.001)\")\n   - Experimentally validated interactions with mechanistic details (e.g., \"JAK inhibition reduced STAT3 phosphorylation by 76% in synovial tissue\")\n   - Genetic associations with functional consequences (e.g., \"The HLA-DRB1 shared epitope increases NF-\u03baB activation through altered peptide presentation\")\n   - Therapeutic targets with molecular rationales (e.g., \"Selective inhibition of BTK reduced osteoclast formation by interrupting RANK-RANKL signaling\")\n\n2. Extract key methodology details that support findings:\n   - Experimental models used (human samples, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Validation approaches (multiple techniques confirming the same finding)\n   - Sample sizes and statistical robustness\n   - Limitations explicitly stated by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your output for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. First paragraph: Concise synthesis of the most significant entity relationships found, focusing on mechanistic connections that could extend the knowledge graph.\n\n2. Main content section: \n   - Present 3-5 key relationship findings in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Group related findings together to show interconnected pathways\n   - Include quantitative data that strengthens relationship evidence\n   - Highlight novel or unexpected relationships that may lead to innovative hypotheses\n\n3. Source documentation:\n   - For each key finding, provide structured citation: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID/DOI]\n   - Assess evidence quality (robust, preliminary, conflicting) for each relationship\n   - Note methodological strengths that increase confidence in findings\n\nRemember that your output will be used to enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation, so prioritize extracting clear entity relationships with directionality, mechanism details, and strength of evidence. Focus on relationship patterns that could reveal non-obvious connections in rheumatology pathogenesis or treatment response.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Heterogeneity in Rheumatoid Arthritis: Mechanisms and Clinical Implications.', 'abstract': 'Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that exhibits significant clinical heterogeneity. There are various treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, including disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), glucocorticoids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and inflammatory cytokine inhibitors (ICI), typically associated with differentiated clinical effects and characteristics. Personalized responsiveness is observed to the standard treatment due to the pathophysiological heterogeneity in rheumatoid arthritis, resulting in an overall poor prognosis. Understanding the role of individual variation in cellular and molecular mechanisms related to rheumatoid arthritis will considerably improve clinical care and patient outcomes. In this review, we discuss the source of pathophysiological heterogeneity derived from genetic, molecular, and cellular heterogeneity and their possible impact on precision medicine and personalized treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. We provide emphasized description of the heterogeneity derived from mast cells, monocyte cell, macrophage fibroblast-like synoviocytes and, interactions within immune cells and with inflammatory cytokines, as well as the potential as a new therapeutic target to develop a novel treatment approach. Finally, we summarize the latest clinical trials of treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis and provide a suggestive framework for implementing preclinical and clinical experimental results into clinical practice.', 'pubYear': '2021', 'doi': '10.3389/fimmu.2021.790122', 'authorString': 'Zhao J, Guo S, Schrodi SJ, He D.'}, {'title': 'Oral Presentations', 'abstract': '<NO ABSTRACT>', 'pubYear': '2024', 'doi': '<NO DOI>', 'authorString': '<NO AUTHOR>'}, {'title': 'Abstracts of the 88th Annual Meeting of the German Society for Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology (DGPT).', 'abstract': '<NO ABSTRACT>', 'pubYear': '2022', 'doi': '10.1007/s00210-022-02205-7', 'authorString': '<NO AUTHOR>'}, {'title': 'EHA2024 Hybrid Congress', 'abstract': '<NO ABSTRACT>', 'pubYear': '2024', 'doi': '<NO DOI>', 'authorString': '<NO AUTHOR>'}, {'title': 'ePosters', 'abstract': '<NO ABSTRACT>', 'pubYear': '2024', 'doi': '<NO DOI>', 'authorString': '<NO AUTHOR>'}, {'title': '17th International Congress of Immunology, 19-23 October 2019, Beijing, China.', 'abstract': '<NO ABSTRACT>', 'pubYear': '2019', 'doi': '10.1002/eji.201970400', 'authorString': '<NO AUTHOR>'}, {'title': 'Abstract Book for the 27th Congress of the European Hematology Association', 'abstract': '<NO ABSTRACT>', 'pubYear': '2022', 'doi': '<NO DOI>', 'authorString': '<NO AUTHOR>'}, {'title': 'Abstracts', 'abstract': '<NO ABSTRACT>', 'pubYear': '2023', 'doi': '<NO DOI>', 'authorString': '<NO AUTHOR>'}, {'title': '10th Congress of International Society of Systemic Auto-Inflammatory Diseases (ISSAID) : Genoa, Italy. 31 March - 3 April 2019', 'abstract': '<NO ABSTRACT>', 'pubYear': '2019', 'doi': '<NO DOI>', 'authorString': '<NO AUTHOR>'}, {'title': 'The 12th World Congress on Inflammation : 8-12 August, 2015 Seaport Hotel and World Trade Center, Boston, USA.', 'abstract': '<NO ABSTRACT>', 'pubYear': '2015', 'doi': '10.1007/s00011-015-0839-4', 'authorString': '<NO AUTHOR>'}, {'title': 'XVI Congress of the Italian Society of Experimental Hematology, Napoli, Italy, October 15-17, 2020.', 'abstract': '<NO ABSTRACT>', 'pubYear': '2020', 'doi': '10.3324/haematol.2020.s2', 'authorString': 'The Authors.'}, {'title': 'Abstracts of the 2013 Annual Meeting of the American College of Rheumatology.

The main features of the syndrome are a triad of recurrent urticaria, monoclonal IgM gammopathy, systemic inflammation associated with recurrent fever, joint and bone pain, and atypical bone remodeling (osteosclerosis). The abnormal activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome produces IL-1, which drives the disease pathology, but it also involves IL-6 and IL-18. Unlike other autoinflammatory diseases, Schnitzler syndrome lacks evidence of the gene divergence causing the abnormal activation of NLRP3. However, mutations in the MEFV and MYD88 genes can be associated with the development of the disease. Due to its rarity, diagnosing the disease can be a challenging task. IL-1 inhibitors (i.e., anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept) are prominent in the treatment of the disease, but the IL-6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab and the Bruton\\'s tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib are also promising alternatives. In this summary article, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the clinical and molecular background of the disease and potential therapeutic targets, based on the cases reported so far. We diagnosed a patient who, to the best of our knowledge, represents the 748th documented case of this specific pathology.

The main pathological manifestation of joint deformity in RA patients is bone destruction, which occurs due to the differentiation and proliferation of osteoclasts. The transcription factor nuclear factor-activated T cell 1 (NFATc1) plays a crucial role in this process. The regulation of NFATc1 in osteoclast differentiation is influenced by three main factors. Firstly, NFATc1 is activated through the upstream nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)/RANK signaling pathway. Secondly, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related co-stimulatory signaling pathway amplifies NFATc1 activity. Finally, negative regulation of NFATc1 occurs through the action of cytokines such as B-cell Lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6), interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), MAF basic leucine zipper transcription factor B (MafB), and LIM homeobox 2 (Lhx2). These three phases collectively govern NFATc1 transcription and subsequently affect the expression of downstream target genes including TRAF6 and NF-\u03baB. Ultimately, this intricate regulatory network mediates osteoclast differentiation, fusion, and the degradation of both organic and inorganic components of the bone matrix. This review provides a comprehensive summary of recent advances in understanding the mechanism of NFATc1 in the context of RA-related bone destruction and discusses potential therapeutic agents that target NFATc1, with the aim of offering valuable insights for future research in the field of RA.

In this study, we synthesized the novel multi-protein kinase inhibitor KMU-11342, based on indolin-2-one. We assessed its cardiac electrophysiological safety using the Langendorff system in rat hearts and evaluated its toxicity in zebrafish in vivo. Additionally, we examined the anti-rheumatic effects of KMU-11342 on human rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS), THP-1 cells, and osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 cells. KMU-11342 demonstrated the ability to inhibit LPS-induced chemokine inhibition and the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, p-IKK\u03b1/\u03b2, p-NF-\u03baB p65, and the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 in RA-FLS.

These proteins are mainly found in the serum and/or urine. Reduction in normal gammaglobulins (immunoparesis) leads to an increased risk of infection. The primary site of origin is the bone marrow for nearly all patients affected by MM with disseminated marrow involvement in most cases. MM is known to involve bones and result in myeloma bone disease. Osteolytic lesions are seen in 80% of patients with MM which are complicated frequently by skeletal-related events (SRE) such as hypercalcemia, bone pain, pathological fractures, vertebral collapse, and spinal cord compression. These deteriorate the patient's quality of life and affect the overall survival of the patient. The underlying pathogenesis of myeloma bone disease involves uncoupling of the bone remodeling processes. Interaction of myeloma cells with the bone marrow microenvironment promotes the release of many biochemical markers including osteoclast activating factors and osteoblast inhibitory factors. Elevated levels of osteoclast activating factors such as RANK/RANKL/OPG, MIP-1-\u03b1., TNF-\u03b1, IL-3, IL-6, and IL-11 increase bone resorption by osteoclast stimulation, differentiation, and maturation, whereas osteoblast inhibitory factors such as the Wnt/DKK1 pathway, secreted frizzle related protein-2, and runt-related transcription factor 2 inhibit osteoblast differentiation and formation leading to decreased bone formation. These biochemical factors also help in development and utilization of appropriate anti-myeloma treatments in myeloma patients. This review article summarizes the pathophysiology and the recent developments of abnormal bone remodeling in MM, while reviewing various approved and potential treatments for myeloma bone disease.\", 'pubYear': '2021', 'doi': '10.3390/ijms22126208', 'authorString': 'Mukkamalla SKR, Malipeddi D.'}, {'title': 'Current advances in regulation of bone homeostasis.', 'abstract': 'Bone homeostasis is securely controlled by the dynamic well-balanced actions among osteoclasts, osteoblasts and osteocytes. Osteoclasts are large multinucleated cells that degrade bone matrix and involve in the bone remodelling in conjunction with other bone cells, osteoblasts and osteocytes, the completely matured form of osteoblasts. Disruption of this controlling balance among these cells or any disparity in bone remodelling caused by a higher rate of resorption by osteoclasts over construction of bone by osteoblasts results in a reduction of bone matrix including bone mineral density (BMD) and bone marrow cells (BMCs). The dominating effect of osteoclasts results in advanced risk of bone crack and joint destruction in several diseases including osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the boosted osteoblastic activity produces osteosclerotic phenotype and weakened its action primes to osteomalacia or rickets. On the other hand, senescent osteocytes predominately progress the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and may contribute to age related bone loss.

However, the tissues and cytokines that play major roles are different in each disease, and as a result, the mechanism of osteochondral destruction also differs.

Due to their exposure on the cell surface and sensitivity to the molecular blockade, integrins have been investigated as pharmacological targets for nearly 40 years, but given the complexity of integrins and sometimes opposite characteristics, targeting integrin therapeutics has been a challenge. To date, only seven drugs targeting integrins have been successfully marketed, including abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban, natalizumab, vedolizumab, lifitegrast, and carotegrast. Currently, there are approximately 90 kinds of integrin-based therapeutic drugs or imaging agents in clinical studies, including small molecules, antibodies, synthetic mimic peptides, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, imaging agents, etc. A serious lesson from past integrin drug discovery and research efforts is that successes rely on both a deep understanding of integrin-regulatory mechanisms and unmet clinical needs.

Indeed, some of the earliest connections among the higher expression of proto-oncogenes (such as <i>MYC</i>), genetic rearrangements and their relation to cancer development were made in Burkitt lymphoma, chronic myeloid leukemia and mouse plasmacytomas. Multiple myeloma (MM), in particular, is a plasma cell malignancy strictly associated with MYC deregulation, suggesting that therapeutic strategies against it would be beneficial in treating this disease.

It is also intimately linked with the progression of COVID-19 disease as well as associated complications and mortality. Therefore, targeting the cytokine storm might help in reducing COVID-19-associated health complications. The number of COVID-19 associated deaths (as of January 15, 2021; https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) in the USA is high (1199/million) as compared to countries like India (110/million). Although the reason behind this is not clear, spices may have some role in explaining this difference. Spices and herbs are used in different traditional medicines, especially in countries such as India to treat various chronic diseases due to their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.<h4>Aim</h4>To evaluate the literature available on the anti-inflammatory properties of spices which might prove beneficial in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 associated cytokine storm.<h4>Method</h4>A detailed literature search has been conducted on PubMed for collecting information pertaining to the COVID-19; the history, origin, key structural features, and mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2; the repurposed drugs in use for the management of COVID-19, and the anti-inflammatory role of spices to combat COVID-19 associated cytokine storm.<h4>Key findings</h4>The literature search resulted in numerous in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials that have reported the potency of spices to exert anti-inflammatory effects by regulating crucial molecular targets for inflammation.<h4>Significance</h4>As spices are derived from Mother Nature and are inexpensive, they are relatively safer to consume.

In controlled trials in CLL, ibrutinib produced high response rates and improved survival in both the frontline and relapsed settings. While ibrutinib controls CLL with impressive efficacy, it only infrequently induces complete remissions, particularly of relapsed CLL, and does not eradicate minimal residual disease. Finally, ibrutinib is extremely expensive, has off-target toxicities, and requires indefinite therapy. Areas covered: In this article, we provide an overview of the CLL therapeutic landscape and discuss the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects of ibrutinib. Major clinical trials of ibrutinib in CLL are summarized, and its safety profile explored. Expert opinion: Ibrutinib represents a transformative advance in CLL management and has validated BTK as a therapeutic target in this disease, but has some limitations, leading to the emergence of other BTK inhibitors and mechanism-based combination strategies.

CES-D scores improved from 20 to 13\\u2009at 12 months, 18\\u2009at 24 months and 14\\u2009at 105 months (p < 0.0001). In the smaller subgroup that underwent cTDR for myelopathy, 10 patients were followed up to 2 years but only 2 reviewed long term (7 lost to follow up, 1 dead). However, these patients only maintained improvement in arm pain seen at 2 year follow up [VAS (preop: 24\\u2009m:105\\u2009m) = 6:4:3] and neck pain was worse [VAS (preop: 24\\u2009m:105\\u2009m) = 6:2:6]. There was deterioration in NDIQ and CESD scores seen in early follow up period, NDIQ (preop: 24\\u2009m:105\\u2009m) 51: 35: 57 and CES -D (pre, post op 2y, follow up 8y) = 20:18:17. There were no adverse events recorded at the time of procedure. There were no revisions performed at the same level, 3 patients had further adjacent level cTDR(2\\u2009at 2 years, 1\\u2009at 9 years) and median survival time was 8.62 years (7.22 to 10.05 95% CI). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Cervical TDR improves pain and function in patients with cervical degenerative disc disease both in the early and long term. We are able to report a survival time of 8.6 years with the Activ C@ prosthesis with no revision surgery performed at the same level. However, the long term benefit of cTDR performed for myelopathy is not clear. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Total disc replacement (TDR) is expected to provide a more physiologic alternative to fusion. However, long term clinical data which proves the efficacy of current implant designs is somewhat lacking. There are inconsistencies between in-vivo clinical vs. in-vitro biomechanical data. Several factors may be contributing to these anomalies, one of which is the type of disc, metal on metal vs. a metal on polyethylene disc design, for example. This study investigates the biomechanical effects of the placement of a novel elastomer TDR in the cervical spine and compares it to natural spinal kinematics, using finite element analysis. <h4>Methods:</h4> An experimentally validated, ligamentous, three-dimensional, finite element model of C3-C7 cervical spine segments was used for this study, Figure 1 (Goel et al., 2009). To simulate the replacement of the FREEFORM cervical TDR, the CAD model of the device was meshed and placed into the disc space of the C4-C5 level following removal of anterior part of the annulus, the entire nucleus, and ALL ligament. The endplates of the TDR were affixed to the adjacent vertebral endplate. Properties of titanium alloy and CarboSil 20 80A silicone rubber were assigned to the endplates and implant\u2019s flexible component, respectively. The intact and instrumented spines were subjected to 75\\u2009N compressive follower load, plus 1.5\\u2009Nm bending moments in anatomical planes to simulate physiological flexion, extension, left/right bending, and left/right rotation. The range of motion, intradiscal pressure, and facet loads were measured and compared for segments of intact and instrumented spines. <h4>Results Section:</h4> The kinematic data for index and superior adjacent levels are shown in Figure 1. The disc replacement did not significantly alter normal motion of the index level in flexion and left/right bending motions (<7% increase). The percent change was more in extension and axial rotation; 28% (Ext) and 23% (LR & RR) respectively. The motion at the superior adjacent segment was not affected in any planes of motions, except in extension (13% decrease) following disc replacement. The intra-discal pressure at the adjacent segment remained essentially unchanged following TDR except in extension, where there was a slight increase. There was not a significant change in facet loads following instrumentation. <h4>Discussion:</h4> The elastomer TDR preserved the natural kinematics of the cervical spine following instrumentation specially in flexion and lateral bending motions. A study by Crawford et al. (IJSS 2012) showed that ProDisc-C increased the ROM of the spine by 11% in flexion and decreased by 30% in lateral bending. Deviation from normal spine kinematics is less substantial with this novel TDR design. Also, the FREEFORM TDR did not alter range of motion, intradiscal pressure, or facet joint stress at the adjacent segment. These biomechanical properties may lower the long-term risk of adjacent segment disc and facet degeneration.Figure 1.

Our group has previously described the development and application of a 9.4\\u2009T MRI nucleus pulposus(NP)/annulus fibrosus(AF) distinction score and the correlation of this simplified scoring system with 3\\u2009T and 9.4\\u2009T MRI Pfirrmann grades. We describe the correlation of the simplified NP/AF distinction score with biochemical measures of intervertebral disc degeneration. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> Eighteen adult ewes underwent surgical lumbar intervertebral disc injury via a lateral retroperitoneal approach. Disc injury was performed at two levels with the adjacent non-injured levels serving as controls. Non-operated lumbar discs served as normal controls. Necropsies were performed at six months. Lumbar spines underwent 9.4\\u2009T MRI axial imaging. Four observers graded the images using the NP/AF distinction score. Spinal columns were dissected, individual discs sectioned, subdivision of the discs into regional segments performed and NP tissues were analysed biochemically for their proteoglycan (as sulphated-glycosaminoglycans), collagen (as hydroxyproline) and DNA content. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS statistical package consisting of Kappa scores for inter-observer reliability, Pearson correlation co-efficients and simple linear regression. <h4>Results:</h4> The 9.4\\u2009T NP/AF distinction score demonstrated good inter-observer reliability with a kappa score of 0.94. A moderately strong correlation between NP/AF distinction score and collagen was observed with a Pearson correlation co-efficient of 0.719 and R2 of 0.517 (both p < 0.001). As expected, there was a negative correlation between NP/AF distinction and nucleus pulposus proteoglycan content with a Pearson correlation co-efficient of -0.545 and R2 of 0.297 (both p < 0.001). There was no significant correlation with nucleus pulposus DNA with a Pearson Correlation score of -0.249 (p = 0.170) and R2 of 0.62 (p = 0.170). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The NP/AF distinction score is a simple system for classifying intervertebral disc degeneration on 9.4\\u2009T MRI that demonstrates high degree of inter-observer reliability. This study demonstrated a moderately strong correlation of NP/AF distinction score with NP collagen content and a weaker negative correlation with proteoglycan content. Increased NP collagen content is a well-described feature of intervertebral disc degeneration and typically occurs in tandem with reduced NP proteoglycan content. The advance in resolution afforded by the 9.4\\u2009T MRI affords the ability to detect subtle changes in intervertebral disc morphology reflective of underlying degenerative and biochemical changes. The strength of correlation observed between this simple radiological classification system and biochemical markers of intervertebral disc degeneration is suggestive of the potential of the 9.4\\u2009T MRI in the investigation and classification of disc degeneration in the future. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) is a common post-surgical complication following long spinal fusion for deformity. Multiple risk factors are associated with PJK, including patient, radiographic, and surgical variables. It is commonly hypothesized that PJK may result from increased post-operative loading of the posterior ligament complex or intra-operative damage to the ligaments themselves. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of sub-laminar polyester tension bands on the biomechanics of the motion segment proximal to a long fusion construct. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> Eight human thoracolumbar spines (T7-L2) were dissected and the end vertebrae were partially embedded in bone cement. Pure moments of 4\\u2009Nm and 8\\u2009Nm were applied to the native spine and the instrumented spine, respectively, in flexion-extension (FE), lateral bending (LB), and axial rotation (AR). The increased load on the instrumented spines was designed to represent the increased post-operative loads that may result from decreased extensor muscle strength or inertial effects adjacent to a stiff fusion construct. The test conditions included: native spine (T7-L2), fused (T10-L2), fused + bilateral bands tensioned to 250\\u2009N at T9-T10 (Bands 250\\u2009N), fused + Bands tensioned to 350\\u2009N (Bands 350\\u2009N), fused (T11-L2) + Bands tensioned to 250\\u2009N at T9-T10 and 350\\u2009N at T10-T11 (2-Level Bands), fused (T10-L2) + hand-tied suture loop through the spinous processes at T9-T10 (Suture Loop), and fused (T10-L2) with the T9-T10 interspinous and supraspinous ligaments cut (Cut ISL/SSL). <h4>Results:</h4> The flexion range of motion (ROM) at T9-T10 of the fused spine, loaded at 8\\u2009Nm, increased to 162% of the native spine loaded at 4\\u2009Nm. The average flexion ROM at T9-T10 for Bands 250\\u2009N, Bands 350\\u2009N, 2-Level Tethers, Suture Loop, and Cut ISL/SSL were 85%, 70%, 93%, 141%, and 177% of the native spine at 4\\u2009Nm, respectively. Each of these conditions was significantly different from Fused (p < 0.05). The tension bands did not significantly affect the ROM in LB or AR. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Biomechanical models of PJK assume that an increased load exists at the proximal segment following fusion, as was observed in this model. As expected, cutting the ISL/SSL ligament complex significantly compromised the flexion stability of the spines, which may be associated with greater PJK risk. On the other hand, the flexion ROM was modulated by varying the tension of the sublaminar bands, which reduces the loads on the posterior ligament complex. However, future studies should identify the optimal tension that will not induce sagittal imbalance or fusion, but will support the spine while the patient adapts to the fusion. <h4>Introduction:</h4> There is growing interest in optimising pedicle screw pull-out strength. While primary pull-out strength has been heavily studied, little is known about revision pull-out strength of different pedicle screws. Our study aims to evaluate the difference in primary and revision pull-out strength using pedicle screws of different thread designs. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> The pull-out strengths of three different pedicle screw designs (single-thread, mixed-thread, dual-thread) were tested in standardised polyurethane foam in three sequences. Sequence 1: A 6.5\\u2009mm screw was inserted into the foam block and the primary pull-out strength measured. Sequence 2: A 6.5\\u2009mm screw was inserted, removed, and then reinserted into the same foam block. The revision pull-out strength was then measured. Sequence 3: A 6.5\\u2009mm screw was inserted, removed and a 7.5\\u2009mm screw of the same thread design was reinserted. The revision pull-out strength was then measured. <h4>Results:</h4> The primary pull-out strength was similar across screw designs, although dual-thread screws showed higher primary pull-out strength (2628.80\\u2009N) compared to single-thread screws (2184.43\\u2009N, p < 0.05). For revision pull-out strength, the mixed-thread screws had significant reduction in revision pull-out strength of 18.6% (1890.15\\u2009N, p = 0.0173). Revision with a larger diameter screw improved the pull-out strength back to baseline. Single and dual-thread screws showed no significant reduction in revision pull-out strength. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Mixed-thread screws are more costly than single and dual thread screws and may not offer any advantage for primary pull-out strength. In cases where screws have to be revised, the revision pull-out strength drops by 18.6% compared to other screw designs. Surgeons should be cautioned and consider using larger diameter mixed-thread pedicle screws in a revision setting if appropriate. <h4>Introduction:</h4> A proper restoration of sagittal alignment is essential in AIS patients, but few studies provided a formula to predict an optimal surgical TK gain in AIS patients. A formula was recently proposed (LL = (PI+TK)/2+10) to predict the optimal lumbar lordosis (LL) in adult spinal deformity patients, which has not been validated in adolescents. The current study aims to establish a formula with thoracic kyphosis (TK) and pelvic parameters in normal adolescents and predict an optimal TK with this formula pre- and post-operatively in Lenke 1 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> A total of 60 asymptomatic adolescents were used to validate the proposed formula. The subject was considered to match with the formula, if the difference between the virtual TK and the theoretical TK was less than 10\u00b0. Then regression analysis was performed to establish a new formula to predict TK in adolescents. The predictive efficiency of the new formula was also validated in 40 Lenke 1 AIS patients. <h4>Results:</h4> Of the 60 asymptomatic adolescents, only 26 (43.33%) asymptomatic adolescents matched with the adjusted formula: TK = 2\u00d7(LL-10)-PI. The paired t test revealed a significantly different theoretical TK (tTK) compared to the virtual TK (41.23 \u00b1 18.29\u00b0 vs. 24.80 \u00b1 8.75\u00b0, P < 0.001). Multiple linear regression showed that TK had a relationship with LL, SS and age (R2 = 0.331): TK = -0.785\u00d7LL-0.843\u00d7SS+0.858\u00d7age+3.754. There were 27 (67.50%), 32 (80.00%) and 35 (87.50%) Lenke 1 AIS patients matched this formula preoperatively, postoperatively and at the last follow-up. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Our results revealed that the predictive formula for sagittal alignment for adults was not applicable in adolescents. This study established a new predictive formula for TK based on asymptomatic adolescents. In Lenke 1 AIS patients, post-op TK in 87.5% of patients matched the predictive value, indicating that the new formula can be considered as a reference when making a surgery strategy. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Sagittal rebalancing of a fixated lumbar hypolordosis (kyphosis) is very important to gain satisfactory results. To correct a misalignment vertebral column resection or pedicle subtraction osteotomies are favored, disregarding the relatively high complication rates. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and safety of a new modified transforaminal lumbar fusion technique as an alternative. <h4>Methods:</h4> We conducted a retrospective review (06/2011-06/2015) of a prospective database at an University hospital. Inclusion criteria were adult patients with a fixated lumbar hypolordosis and the need of monosegmental correction of more than 10\u00b0 with an mTLIF. Exclusion criteria consisted of minor aged patients and polysegmental corrections. Study parameters were the perioperative complications and the achieved postsurgical lordosis. The follow up period was 6 months. <h4>Results:</h4> A total of 11 patients could be included. The mean segmental lordosis was -2.3\u00b0 \u00b1 12.4\u00b0 (range -22\u00b0 to 14\u00b0) preoperative and 15.5\u00b0 \u00b1 10.5\u00b0 (range 0\u00b0 to 29\u00b0) postoperative. The degree of correction was 17\u00b0 \u00b1 5.7\u00b0 in mean per treated segment (range 12\u00b0 to 29\u00b0). No neurologic or vascular complications occurred. No substantial loss of correction or implant failure was noted during the 6-month follow-up. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The modified transforaminal lumbar fusion technique is a safe method to correct a fixated lumbar kyphosis. The potential of segmental correction is comparable to pedicle subtraction osteotomies but sparing potentially healthy segments. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Proximal junction kyphosis (PJK) and proximal junctional failure are common complications of surgical treatment for adult spinal deformity. The incidence of PJK/PJF is reported at 20-40%; of these cases, about 50% will undergo revision surgery for PJK. Revision surgery for PJK/PJF approximately doubles the cost of surgical treatment for ASD and is estimated at 77\\u2009432 US dollars per revision surgery. Risk factors contributing to PJK have been extensively investigated. Both patient specific and modifiable risk factors have been identified. Important modifiable risk factors include implant design, construct design, degree of correction, disruptions of posterior elements, and combined anterior/posterior procedures. Despite known, construct specific, modifiable risk factors, the optimal construct design to prevent PJK remains elusive. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> A total of 19 patients (3 men and 16 women) underwent posterior fusion using a unique, staggered technique for pedicle screw-rod construct, whereby the upper instrumented vertebra was varied by either 1 or 2 levels from the contralateral pedicle screw-rod construct. Patients were included if they were older than 18 years old and were undergoing either primary or revision surgery for ASD. Patients with previous surgery for ASD, including those with previous development of PJK were not excluded. Patients undergoing fixation for acute trauma, compression fracture, and neoplastic deformity were excluded. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 28 months. The primary outcome measure was defined as re-operation rate due to proximal junctional kyphosis. Secondary measures included the rate of complications such as PJK not requiring revision, pseudoarthrosis formation, instrumentation failure, infection, and upper instrumentation pain. <h4>Results:</h4> One patient required revision due to PJK. In this patient, PJK occurred concomitantly with infection and upper instrumentation failure at 23 months post-operatively. One additional patient developed radiographically significant PJK but remains clinically asymptomatic. Two additional patients required reoperation for infection. Minor complications included superficial wound infection (1 patient), temporary motor deficit (2 patients), and upper instrumentation pain (2 patients). The average number of instrumented levels was 9.74 (range 5 to 15). On average, kyphosis at the proximal instrumented vertebrae increased 4.26 degrees (range -8 to 24). 2 patients were lost to follow up. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Asymmetric screw rod fixation is a safe technique with the potential to decrease proximal junctional kyphosis, proximal junctional failure, and therefore, revision spine surgery for adult spinal deformity. <h4>Introduction:</h4> to study the effect of the parameters of the local sagittal balance of the cervical spine on the quality of life of patients operated on for degenerative-dystrophic disease. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> From 2014 till 2017 56 patients with lumbar spine scoliosis were operated in the Federal Neurosurgical Center (50 men and 50 women). The patients\u2019 age was 49,8 \u00b1 9,8 years. The mean follow-up period was 23.6 \u00b1 12.4 months. Patients\u2019 neurological status evaluation was performed according to Japanese Orthopedic Association 1994 (JOA). The severity of the pain syndrome was assessed by a visual analogue pain scale (VAS). To assess the quality of life, the Neck Disability Index (NDI) questionnaire was used (H. Veron, J. Mior, 1989) according to the scale of The Short Form-36 (SF36). Neuroimaging methods included MRI, MSCT and X-ray. According to the radiographs, the assessment of the Sagittal vertical axis (SVA) C2-C7, the SVA center gravity of the head (CGH) -C7, the Cobb angle C2-C7, the Spino-cranial angle (SCA), the Thoracic inlet angle (TIA) neck tilt NT), T1 slope, C7 slope, Cranial incidence (CI), Cranial slope (CS), Cranial tilt (CT). <h4>Results:</h4> During the follow-up period, a positive correlation was found between C7 Slope and NDI (r = 0.31, p = 0.02). Perhaps a negative relationship between C7 Slope and SF36-PH (r = -0.27, p = 0.06). Positive correlation (on the verge of significance) between SVA C2-C7 and NDI (r = 0.24, p = 0.08). The value of the NDI questionnaire (p = 0.03) is worse in the group of patients with SVA C2-C7 more than 40\\u2009mm. In the group with \u201cfront\u201d surgery, more than 75% of patients have SVA CGH-C7 less than 40\\u2009mm, in the \u201cback\u201d - more than 40\\u2009mm in all patients (p = 0.01). The balance after surgery is compensated in the most patients in the group of ventral surgery. Meanwhile, SVA CGH-C7 and clinical studies have not been detected, although SVA CGH-C7 and C2-7 strongly correlate (SVA CGH-C7 and SVA C2-7 (p = 0.000)). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The parameters of C7 slope, SVA C2-C7 of the local sagittal balance statistically significantly affect the patient\u2019s quality of life (according to NDI, SF-36). A statistically significant threshold for SVA C2-C7 for decompensating the sagittal balance was 40\\u2009mm. In patients after ventral surgery SVA CGH-C7 is reliably below 40\\u2009mm, however, no statistically significant correlation was found with clinical outcomes. <h4>Introduction:</h4> To identify perioperative complications in the elderly undergoing single-level posterolateral fusion versus interbody fusion for spondylolisthesis. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> Retrospective data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database for the years 2012 \u2013 2014 were used to evaluate 30\\u2009day outcomes. Adult patients who underwent single-level posterolateral fusion (PLF) and posterolateral interbody fusion (PLIF) for spondylolisthesis were identified. Outcomes were compared between current smokers (within one year of surgery) and non-smokers. <h4>Results:</h4> Between 2012 and 2014, 1,688 patients who underwent single-level PLF or PLIF for spondylolisthesis were identified from the ACS-NSQIP database. Among these, a total of 1,599 patients between the ages of 45 \u2013 79 (94.7%) and 89 patients (5.3%) were 80 years or older. In the elderly group, there were 33 patients who underwent PLIF (37.1%). Overall, there were no significant differences in demographics or comorbidities between the PLF and PLIF groups. However, operative time was significantly longer for elderly patients who underwent PLIF vs PLF (3.0 \u00b1 1.3 vs. 2.4 \u00b1 1.0 hours, p = 0.036). In terms of 30-day outcomes, elderly patients who underwent PLIF had a higher complication rate (12.1% vs. 5.4%), though this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.416). Similarly, readmission (6.1% vs. 5.4%, p = 1.00) and reoperation (3.0% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.371) rates were higher for PLIF vs PLF patients without reaching significance. Compared to middle-age patients, patients in the elderly group were significantly more likely to be hypertensive (80.9% vs. 59.8%, p < 0.001) and dependent (9.0% vs. 2.1%, p < 0.001) compared to younger patients. Similarly, a significantly higher proportion of patients in the elderly group were more likely to be ASA Class 3 \u2013 4 compared to the younger group (67.4% vs. 47.4%, p = 0.002). On the other hand, middle-age patients were more likely to be smokers compared patients 80 years or older (16.8% vs. 3.4%, p < 0.001. In terms of operative parameters, middle-age patients were more likely to undergo interbody fusion (63.9% vs. 37.1%, p < 0.001) but also longer operative times (3.1 \u00b1 1.4 hours vs. 2.7 \u00b1 1.2 hours, p < 0.001). Length of stay was longer for elderly patients compared to younger patients (4.6 \u00b1 4.2 days vs. 3.3 \u00b1 2.8 days, p = 0.005). Lastly, perioperative complication (3.6% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.873), readmission (4.8% vs. 4.0%, p = 0.454), and reoperation (2.8% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.483) rates were not significantly different between the PLIF and PLF groups, respectively for patients aged 45 to 79. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Octogenarians, although make up a smaller percentage of operative patients, are not at a higher rate of complication compared to their younger counterparts. The findings of this study may help spine surgeons and patients for preoperative risk stratification and perioperative expectations. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Due to the significant shortage of Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP-2) in Europe at the beginning of 2016, a new technique was developed to combine the osteoconductive, osteogenic and osteoinductive properties of bone grafts. Prior to 2016, a combination of fresh frozen femoral head (FFFH) (osteoconductive) and BMP-2 (osteoinductive) was used inside the fusion cage, with excellent results. The technique involved inserting BMP-2 into two drill holes inside the FFFH, a technique adopted from Gold Coast Spine, Australia. We describe a new technique of replacing the BMP-2 with a core of cancellous iliac crest bone autograft, obtained using a cannulated core biopsy needle. Inserting this autologous cancellous bone core inside a drilled tunnel in the cancellous FFFH allograft added osteogenic and osteoinductive properties to the structural osteoconductive FFFH graft. The fusion was assessed using fine cut CT scan. To our knowledge this technique has not been described before. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> This is a prospective review of 50 consecutive patients (total 53 levels fused) who underwent Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (ALIF) between 2016-2017. All patients had a routine fine cut CT scan at 4-5 months post-operatively to assess for fusion. The CT scan was reviewed by a consultant radiologist to assess the presence of fusion. All patients had ALIF at L4/5 and/or L5/S1 using a Brantigan\u00ae cage and Aegis\u00ae plate (Depuy-Synthes). A combination of FFFH allograft and iliac crest core autograft were used. Two blocks of cancellous FFFH allograft were cut to the size of the graft windows using an electric saw. A core of cancellous iliac crest bone was inserted through a drill hole in the middle of each block of FFFH. The autograft was obtained from the left iliac crest through a stab incision in the skin. Once the 10 gauge Stryker\u00ae biopsy needle was through the cortical bone, the stylet was removed and the needle advanced 4-5\\u2009cm, continuously rotating the needle. <h4>Results:</h4> 50 consecutive patients who underwent ALIF procedures for degenerative conditions were included. There were 32 females. The mean age was 44.2 (33.6-70.3) years. 29 patients had surgery at L5/S1, 18 patients at L4/5 and 3\\u2009at L4/5 and L5/S1. 11 patients had surgery for spondylolisthesis, 14 for recurrent disc prolapse, 20 for neuroforaminal stenosis due to significant loss of disc height, and 5 for DDD. There was radiological fusion in 49 patients (52 levels) (98%), and non-union in one. The patient who had radiological non-union was a 42 year old female, non-smoker, and had surgery for DDD. There were no complications at the donor site (pain or infection). There was no VTE, and no intra-operative complications. The average blood loss was 90 mls (40-160 mls). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Combining iliac crest cancellous bone autograft, obtained through a minimally invasive technique, with cancellous allograft is effective with good union rate (98%), without complications from the donor site. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Indocyanine green (ICG) videoangiography is a new technique that allows for real-time evaluation of blood flow in the aneurysm and vessels. Intra-operative indocyanine green (ICG) videoangiography is a useful addition to cerebrovascular neurosurgery. We evaluate the usefulness and limitation of ICG videoangiography during the cervical posterior fixation to evaluate the patency of the vertebral artery in the cases with high risk of VA injury. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> Twenty-three patients (15 female, 8 male; mean age, 54.4 years) were evaluated. Near infrared ICG angiography was applied after the posterior screw fixation in the cases of high riding VA at the level of C2 vertebra, V3 segment anomaly and the situation of the VA injury was suspected during the surgical procedure. <h4>Results:</h4> ICG videoangiography is useful in different types of upper cervical posterior surgery. This technique is useful to evaluate the VA patency after screw instrumentation especially in the cases of the VA anomaly and high riding VA. And it is useful to identify the vessel patency after the inevitable VA management during the procedure. Overall, the procedure interrupted the surgical procedure for less than 5 minutes. One case of adverse skin reaction to the dye was encountered due to the dye leakage outside the vessel during the injection. ICG videoangiography has some limitations such as its inability to be viewed outside of the observed plane of illumination with infrared light and inconsistent complete washout, making repeated viewing sometimes difficult in structures surrounded by thick and excessive tissue. Quantitative evaluation of vessel flow is not possible with ICG videoangiography. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> ICG angiography could be a simple intraoperative evaluating tool with which the patency of the extracranial vertebral artery can be assessed. Compared with digital subtraction angiography, ICG angiography requires less time, personnel, and equipment, is safer, and can resolve smaller vessels, but is limited by the surgeon\u2019s viewing angle and the depth of penetration of the infrared light. Even though it is necessary to expose the VA above the C1 arch or lateral to the C1 lateral mass to identify the ICG flow in the cases of CVJ surgery, it can be a useful tool to verify the patency of the possibly damaged VA during the screw placement. Unlike ultrasound technology, this technique is a hands-off method that can inform the surgeon about the flow patency of the extracranial vertebral artery. <h4>Introduction:</h4> The incidence of serious cervical spine injuries is low but associated rates of death and disability are high. In both British and Chinese studies, cervical spine is the most commonly affected region among traumatic spinal cord injuries (Lenehan, 2012). Cervical spinal cord injury is a devastating event for the patient and family. Mortality associated with cervical spine fractures is less studied. This deficiency in the literature contributes to a lack of consensus on the optimal treatment of cervical fractures (Jackson, 2005). <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> All patients admitted at Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital (Negros Occidental, Philippines), Dr. Pablo O. Torre Memorial Hospital (Negros Occidental, Philippines), and Silliman Medical Center (Negros Oriental, Philippines), from January 2008 to December 2012 with cervical SCI secondary to trauma are included in the study. Charts of patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were collected. Patients were categorized according to age group. After collection of data it was double entered in Excel file, and was analyzed using SPSS (version 16\u00b70) software. <h4>Results:</h4> The study group comprised of 51 males (92.7%), and 4 females (7.3%). Patients\u2019 age were from 15 to 76 years old, with mean age of 43.67 years ( \u00b1 16.9, SD). Common cause of injury in 27 patients was fall (49.1%), followed by vehicular accident sustained by 25 patients (45.5%), and axial loading in remaining 3 (5.5%). Incomplete quadriplegia was sustained by 32 patients (58.2%), and complete quadriplegia (Frankel A) in the remaining 23 patients (41.8%). Eleven patients died in their hospital stay (20%), most had complete quadriplegia- Frankel A (n = 10; 43.5%), compared to incomplete quadriplegia (n = 1; 3.1%). Statistical analysis showed no significance between sexes (LRT = 0.064, df = 1, p = 0.8), as well as the cause of injury (x2 = 0.833, df = 2, p = 0.659) for mortality of the patient. Analysis however, showed a significant relationship of the extent of paralysis and mortality (x2 = 11.214, df = 1, p-0.001), as only 1 out of 31 patients with incomplete quadriplegia (3.1%) eventually expired, compared to 10 of 23 (43.5%) in completely quadriplegic patients. Last normal motor and sensory level did not show a significant statistical relationship to mortality (LR = 8.17, df = 6, p = 0.226). Radiographic abnormality, presence of spinal shock on admission, and patient\u2019s age, showed no statistical significance to the mortality of the patient. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> This study showed that males of older adult group usually sustained cervical spinal cord injury either due to fall, or motor vehicular accident, with almost half having fracture-dislocation. Statistical analyses showed no significant relationship of age, sex, level of injury, and mechanism of injury to mortality. There is however a statistically significant relationship of extent of injury, particularly Frankel A, to eventual mortality of the patient. Surgical procedure can be a positive predictor for survival in cervical SCI patients. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Scoliosis has long been measured in the 2D AP plane using the Cobb angle, which does not account for axial vertebral rotation (VR). In the past, the Stagnara lateral has been used in attempt to correct for VR. To date, no similar view has been described for the AP plane. 3D CT imaging may allow for more accurate measurement of Cobb angles by compensating for axial VR. We hypothesized that Cobb angles obtained from the rotationally compensated images differ significantly from those on traditional AP radiograph. <h4>Methods:</h4> In this retrospective study, standard AP, lateral, and bending radiographs of 23 patients age 10-17 with AIS were obtained. Using multi-planar 3D CT, the coronal plane was reconstructed within the plane of the vertebral axis to form a rotationally compensated 3D CT image (RC-3DCT). The following measurements were made on both imaging modalities: PT, MT, TL/L curve, coronal balance, T/L-AVT, T/L-AVR, thoracic kyphosis, and sagittal balance. <h4>Results:</h4> The mean MT curve was found to be 52.50\u00b0 on AP radiograph vs. 45.36\u00b0 on RC-3DCT (P = 0.011). In 3 patients (13.04%), rotational compensation altered the end vertebra of the major curve by at least 1 level. The mean TL curve obtained on radiograph, was significantly larger than that of RC-3DCT (42.93 vs. 34.32\u00b0; P = 0.00\\u2009210). AP films overstated coronal balance by over 50% when compared to RC-3DCT (P = 0.0320). Mean T-AVT was measured to be 37.04\\u2009mm on conventional films and 29.8\\u2009mm on RC-3DCT (P = 0.028). RC-3DCT L-AVT was significantly smaller than that of standard films (P = 0.034). Mean T-AVR on standing film was 18.9 \u00b1 11.2\u00b0. The mean thoracic kyphosis greatly differed between the two modalities: 33.69\u00b0on radiograph vs. 20.04\u00b0 on RC-3DCT (P = 2.16x10-5). <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Measurements traditionally made on AP radiograph to evaluate scoliosis may be fundamentally inaccurate due to VR. Our data suggests that axial rotation of a patient 19\u00b0 per Nash\u2013Moe grade with respect to the coronal plane may adequately compensate for the rotational component of deformity without the need for CT. Additionally, rotational compensation may yield end vertebrae levels different from those obtained traditionally. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Spondylodiscitis, a term encompassing vertebral osteomyelitis, spondylitis and discitis, is the main manifestation of haematogenous osteomyelitis in patients aged over 50 years. Staphylococcus aureus is the predominant pathogen, accounting for about half of non-tuberculous cases. Diagnosis is difficult and often delayed or missed due to the rarity of the disease, particularly in the cervical spine. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> We present the case of a 57 year old female patient whose medical history was significant for nodal skin lesions encompassing her arms and forearms, her presternal region, and her back. Some lesions were encrusted due to previous hemorrhagic blistering from persistent scratching. She suffered from these skin lesions for twenty years, treated them withtopical ointments, and was followed up at dermatologists. She was also referred for allergy testing which proved negative for all common contact, nutritive and inhalational allergens, and so her condition was diagnosed as a neurodermatitis. She presented to the emergency neurological department with axial neck pain referring to the right shoulder and arm, she was non- febrile and with no neurological impairment. She was discharged with a diagnosis of cervicobrachial syndrome and referred to physical therapy and rehabilitation specialist. The next day she developed an increased temperature of 39.7\\u2009oC with rapidly worsening axial neck pain and symptoms of septicaemia and was admitted urgently in a clinic for infectious diseases. Bloodculture was positive for methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and antibiotic therapy with cloxacillin was promptly initiated. Four days later she began manifesting motor deficits in the distribution of myotomes C4 - (strength \u2157), C5 - (\u2157), C6 - (\u2155), C7 - (\u2158), C8 - (\u2158). An emergency MRI of her cervical spine showed an paravertebral abscess in the right C3-C7 region and MRI characteristics of spondylodiscitis of her C5 and C6 vertebral bodies. She was then urgently transferred to our clinic for emergent surgical treatment. We performed a left sided anterior cervical approach, corpectomy of C5 and C6, drainage of the abscess, lavage and reconstruction of the anterior column with a MESH cage filled with autologous trabecular bone from her ipsilateral iliac crest and anterior cervical locking plate fixation from C4 to C7. <h4>Results:</h4> The immediate postoperative period was uneventful. Her neck was immobilized with neck collar. Immediate postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) pain score was 3-4/10 using NSAID only. Rifampicin was added to her anthibiotic regiment immediately postoperatively to prevent biofilm formation along the implant. Drainage was removed on the second postoperative day and her fever subsided. Neurologic improvement was witnessed by the third postoperative day. She was transferred back to the infectious diseases clinic from where she was initially transferred to us for further intravenous antibiotic treatment as per the spondylodiscitis protocol. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Spondylodiscitis can be a rare complication of pyogenic skin infection, including one resulting from neurodermatitis due to breach in skin integrity from persistent scratching. <h4>Introduction:</h4> In the 21st century, there has been a significant increase in attention to the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) as a source of low back pain. Many studies have shown positive outcomes of minimally invasive (MIS) SIJ fusion. The purpose of this study is to examine patient reported outcomes for this procedure in a United States Military Veterans population. Previous studies on other health conditions have suggested differences between normal and veteran populations, with the latter having lower health scores in addition to being predominantly male. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> This study is a retrospective case series of our experience with twenty-one MIS SIJ fusions using triangular ingrown titanium rods in twenty patients at our local Veterans Affairs Medical Center from August 2011 through February 2014. Of our twenty patients, seventeen were male and three were female and they had an average age of 56 years. Surgical indications were based on history, physical exam, and diagnostic sacroiliac joint injections. Primary diagnosis was degenerative sacroiliitis in all cases except one of chronic SIJ infection. Patient reported outcomes (numeric pain scores and Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]) were collected pre and post operatively with final outcomes at greater than two years for all patients. Final follow up was at an average of 3.3 years and was completed for 18/20 patients. <h4>Results:</h4> At final follow up, ODI improved from 57.9 pre-operatively to 44.3 (p = 0.02) at final follow up. Signifiant improvement was seen by three months post operatively and this was maintained through final follow up. The VAS score for back pain improved from 6.7 to 5.8\\u2009at final follow up. The VAS score showed regression after the first year of follow up. Mean operative time was 96 minutes (range 53-244). Mean blood loss was an average of 80\\u2009cc (range 25-350). Mean hospital stay was an average of 1.5 days (range 1-4) with all but one patient discharging home from the hospital. There was one complication noted in our series which was a return to OR secondary to pseudoarthrosis. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion is an effective treatment of low back pain in the right patient. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Minimally Invasive Lumbar Interbody Fusion is a retroperitoneal approach which uses corridor between psoas and great vessels. Here we have retrospectively analyzed its early radiological & clinical outcomes in degenerative lumbar spine disease. <h4>Methods:</h4> OLIF was carried out in 49 segments of 38 patients from May 2016 to August 2017. Patients with degenerative lumbar spine disease were included whereas patients with infection, trauma, lumbar disc prolapse, severe bony canal stenosis, lysthesis of grade 3 or more were excluded. 34 patients (45 segments) were included in this study. All patients were operated from left side. 40 segments had posterior percutaneous and 5 segments had anterior fixation. Auto graft was used in 21 patients (31 segments) and artificial bone graft was used in 13 patients (14 segments). Indirect decompression by distraction was achieved in all patients. Neuromonitioring was not used. Clinical assessment was done according to modified Macnab\u2019s criteria. Radiological assessment was done on lateral radiographs of lumbosacral spine & MRI. Percentage improvement in foraminal height, disc height, reduction of lysthesis & increase in segmental lordosis were measured on radiographs and increase in overall area of spinal canal was evaluated on MRI scans. <h4>Results:</h4> Out of 34 patients 11 were male and 23 were female. Average age was 63 years. Single segment fusion was done in 24, 2 segment fusion in 9 and 3 segment fusion was done in 1 patient. Average follow up was 5 months. By modified Macnab\u2019s criteria, 24 patients (70.59%) had excellent, 8 patients (23.53%) had good & 2 patients (5.88%) had fair outcomes. None required direct decompression. Per operative complications included rupture of iliolumbar vein in 1(2.94%), breach of peritoneum and fracture of superior endplate of inferior vertebrae in 2 (5.88%) patients. All patients had postoperative graft site pain in which autograft was taken. Graft site fracture occurred in 2 (5.88%) patients which got healed within 3 weeks. Ipsilateral psoas weakness/ pain was seen in 11 (32.35%) patients which got resolved within 3 weeks. 1 (2.94%) patient had superficial /deep infection. 6 (17.64%) had contralateral radiculopathy with motor deficit in 1 patient. 3(8.82%) of them required direct decompression. Conservatively managed patients recovered partial to fully within 1\\u2009month. 1(2.94%) patient had numbness in area distribution of left genitofemoral nerve. Overall complication rate was 40.12%. On radiological assessment, overall improvement in foraminal height was 20.78%, disc height improved by 97.32%, average lysthesis reduction was 7.1%, increase in segmental lordosis was 3.16o.36 segments were studied on T2\\u2009W MRI axial scans. Overall improvement in spinal canal area was 46.54%. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Early clinical outcomes of this study have shown excellent to good results & also significant increase in foraminal height, disc height, segmental lordosis, spinal canal area and reduction of listhesis on radiological assessment with low rate of irreversible complications. <h4>Introduction:</h4> A retrospective and prospective analysis of the surgical treatment and results of 118 patients with benign and malignant craniocervical, atlantoaxial and high cervical lesions operated during 60 \u2013 month period (2011-2016) at our Department was performed. The aim of the analysis was to assess the factors affecting dorsal fusion as correction of craniocervical and high cervical instability. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> We analyzed 84 patients with traumatic lesions, 10 patients with inflammatory lesions, 8 patients with degenerative instability, and 16 patients with high cervical tumors. <h4>Results:</h4> In 118 patients we performed 132 operations. We used posterior cervical, and craniocervical median approach. Because of craniocervical/cervical instability we made posterior screw fixation in all of 118 patients. In order to improve screw placement accuracy we performed intraoperative O-Arm in 102 cases. The operative duration was 2.15\\u2009h. in O-Arm operations and 4.35\\u2009h in C-arm operation. The blood loss was 300\\u2009ml in O-Arm and 550\\u2009ml in C-Arm procedures. The mean screw length in C1/C2 vertebras was 30\\u2009mm in O- Arm procedures and 24\\u2009mm in C-Arm procedures. The most common operative complications were: CSF leak \u2013 in 2 cases, postoperative infection \u2013 in 5 cases, screw misplacement - in 2 cases (in C- Arm procedures) without early operative mortality. The 12-monts follow-up showed good recovery in 79 patients, moderate disabling \u2013 25 patients, severe disabling \u2013 5 patients, vegetative state \u2013 4 patients, death 5 patients with malignant lesions. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Early correction of craniocervical and high cervical instability facilitated neurological recovery by preserving the existent neurological function. Using of O-Arm increase operative screw placement accuracy, and preserve intraoperative nerve and vertebral artery injury. Recently because of the improvement of neuroimaging techniques, operative approaches, surgical techniques and neurointensive care the results of treatment of these lesions are optimal. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Although pedicle screws have been regarded as the first-line choice for fixation of C7, they may require radiographic or fluoroscopic guidance, take time for placement, and have a potential risk of neurovascular complications. Given such limitations, C7 laminar screw might serve as a viable alternative. However, while laminar screws are widely used for C2 fixation, reports on the clinical experience of C7 laminar screws are quite limited. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy and safety of C7 laminar screw placement with a free-hand technique. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> All patients who underwent posterior cervical fixation with C7 laminar screws by the last author were chosen. All screws were placed with a free-hand technique without radiographic or fluoroscopic guidance. The operating time for each screw placement was approximately 1-2 minutes. Clinical information and radiologic data of the patients were analyzed. Using postoperative CT scans, which were taken in all patients, the accuracy of screw placement was evaluated by two orthopedic surgeons by assessing the direction (dorsal versus ventral) and degree of laminar cortical breach. <h4>Results:</h4> Forty-three consecutive patients were enrolled. There were 26 males and 17 females, and the age averaged 59 years (range, 14-82). A total of 61 C7 laminar screws were used: twenty-five patients underwent unilateral C7 laminar screw fixation, and eighteen patients underwent bilateral fixation (Figs 1 and 2). All the laminar screws were 3.5\\u2009mm in diameter and 20 to 26\\u2009mm in length (3 20-mm, 13 22-mm, 38 24-mm, and 7 26-mm screws). Of the 61 screws, 14 screws (23%) breached the laminar cortical wall, including 3 dorsal and 11 ventral breaches. Of those 14 screws, 11 screws (18%) breached by less than 50% of screw diameter and 3 screws (5%) breached by more than 50% but less than 100% of screw diameter. Nine screws were one of the screws placed bilaterally, and 5 screws were unilaterally placed. No intraoperative neurovascular injury was observed, and none of the screws with cortical breaches resulted in worsening of neurologic symptoms. None of the patients required reoperation for any reason. Over the follow-up period of 20 months, mechanical failure such as loosening or fractures of screw-rod system has not been observed. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> To our knowledge, this is the largest clinical study ever performed on C7 laminar screw fixation. Although laminar cortical breach was common (25%) with our free-hand technique, most were trivial and none had clinically relevant neurovascular complications nor mechanical failures. Therefore, C7 laminar screws, which can be placed quickly and easily without the need of radiographic or fluoroscopic guidance, may provide a valuable alternative to pedicle screws for C7 fixation in terms of efficacy and safety. However, long-term outcomes, including fusion status, remains to be evaluated with further follow-up. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Severe pediatric deformity can be extremely challenging to treat due to difficulties with instrumentation placement in small patients, stress on implants due to correction of severe deformities, and use of three column osteotomies. This study analyzed the instrumentation and fusion related complications in complex spine deformity surgical cases. Hypotheses: pediatric patients with severe spinal deformities treated surgically have a high rate of revision surgery for instrument and fusion related complications. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> This was a prospective observational multi center cohort of pediatric patients having surgical treatment for severe spinal deformity ( > 100\u00b0 or planned VCR). 176 patients with severe complex spinal deformity were included from a prospective database with a min. 2 year follow-up. Complications with or without revision due to pseudoarthrosis, instrumentation failure, infection requiring instrumentation removal and progression of deformity were all analyzed. <h4>Results:</h4> 176 patients out of 313 pts reached a minimum of 2 years follow up. 21 patients (12%) had complications associated with the instrumentation. 15 patients (9%) required 16 revision surgeries because of instrumentation failure. 6 patients (3%) had complications but did not require any revisions. The 16 revision surgeries included 7 (43%) with loss of fixation. The average time for the revision surgery was 13 months (0-28) after the index surgery. Only one patient had 2 revisions. 4 patients were revised for pseudarthrosis at an average of 23 months (17-35). 2 patients (13%) had revisions for prominent instrumentation (both at 27 mos postop), 2 (13%) for infection (19 and 36 months respectively), and one patient had revision surgery for deformity progression at 2 months postoperatively. The patients that did not have revision surgeries included 2 with prominent implants both found at 18 months postop, 2 with progressive deformity/PJK at 18 months average (14-22), and 2 had loss of fixation at 6 months (0-12). <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Pediatric patients with severe spinal deformity are high risk for revision surgeries at 12% rate within 2 years. The average time for revision surgery was 19 months postoperatively. These patients require close follow-up and will require continued follow-up after 2 years. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Cervical spinal cord injury is a devastating consequence of high energy trauma and despite of advances in emergency care of quadriplegia patients it is associated with high in-hospital mortality. We conducted systematic review of current literature to identify the predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients with cervical spinal cord injury. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> Two independent reviewers conducted systematic review of English literature between period January 2000 and May 2017 for articles reporting predictors of in-hospital mortality after traumatic spinal cord injuries. Review was conducted according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines using a PRISMA checklist. Inclusion criteria were studies with more than 50 adult patients (18 years or older) with traumatic spinal cord injury and reporting predictors of mortality. We included those predictors when at least two studies were available for those predictors. The method of best evidence synthesis for observational studies were used to analyse the quality of each studies and for synthesis of final evidence. <h4>Results:</h4> The search strategy resulted in 8 articles. Three studies were rated as \u2018high quality\u2019, one study as \u2018moderate quality\u2019 and four as \u2018low quality\u2019. Increasing age, higher cervical level, early surgical decompression, higher ASIA grade at presentation, ventilatory requirements and cardiovascular stability are all observed to be associated with high in-hospital mortality in this patient population. Increasing age and longer ventilatory support were consistently found to be associated with high in-hospital mortality with moderate grade of evidence. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> Whilst there is no conclusive strong evidence of the predictors for in-hospital mortality following cervical spinal cord injury, special attention should be paid to the above observed predictors. Further prospective studies are warranted in large samples that can delineate the most effective predictor or combination scheme of predictors to ultimately aid clinicians risk stratify the patients and improve the survival outcome. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Surgery in neurological deficit due to delayed collapse of non-healing osteoporotic fractures is often met with complication due to associated co-morbidity and potential of instrumentation failure. Management of OFND is controversial. <h4>Material and Methods:</h4> 40 patients with neurological deficit due to delayed osteoporotic vertebral collapse managed by posterior surgery (decompression + instrumentation + transpedicular bone graft) with minimum 2 years follow up included. Demographic data (age, sex, mode of injury, severity of osteoporosis, duration of delay in presentation); clinical parameters [Visual Analogous score (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Frankel grade], radiological parameters (local kyphosis), surgical variables (blood loss, surgery duration, intra-operative problems) recorded. Neurological worsening /improvement, complications, implant loosening /failures were noted. <h4>Results:</h4> Significant improvement noted in VAS (pre-op 8.20 \u00b1 0.65/post-op 4.1 \u00b1 0.64), ODI (Pre op 76.54 \u00b1 6.96/Post op 30.5 \u00b1 6.56). Complete neurological recovery noted in 37 patients (Frankel grade E), 3 patients remained non ambulatory (Frankel grade C). Significant improvement noted in local kyphosis angle (pre op = 21.80 \u00b1 2.70; post op 11.40 \u00b1 1.80), with 10% loss of correction (2.5+/-0.90) at final follow up. Symptomatic implant failure was noted in 2 patients and proximal junctional failure in 1 patient requiring revision. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> OFND can be managed with single posterior surgery (decompression + instrumentation+ transpedicular bone-graft) with significant improvement in neurology and functional scores of patient. Aggressive kyphosis correction often not required and significant correction of kyphosis is noticed due to positioning alone. Transpedicular grafting is safe and simple alternative to cement augmentation or anterior surgery for collapsed vertebrae. <h4>Introduction:</h4> Surgical and clinical outcomes were reviewed to determine the biological behavior and prognostic factors of atypical spinal meningioma. Because of the scarcity of atypical meningioma, there is a lack of research on this type of tumor and malignant transformation. <h4>Methods:</h4> We retrospectively reviewed the data from all patients on whom we performed spinal cord tumor removal between 1994 and 2016. Seventeen patients were pathologically proved to have atypical meningioma. Surgical extent and disease progression were established by the surgeon according to operative findings, postoperative MRI, and outpatient department (OPD) follow-up. <h4>Results:</h4> Seventeen patients were included in the analysis, 12 (70%) of whom had tumors in the thoracic region, 4 (24%) of whom had tumors in the cervical region, and 1 (6%) of whom had tumors in the sacral region. Complete resection was achieved in 15 (88%) patients, and subtotal resection was performed in 2 (12%) patients. 4 (24%) patients had metastatic meningioma from brain. Among 4 patients, 3 patients administered radiotherapy after surgery as adjuvant radiotherapy. One patient who underwent surgery for anaplastic meningioma in the brain recurred, and underwent three operations in the spine. The 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 88.3%, while the 5- and 10-year recurrence-free survival rates were 83% and 52%, respectively. Additionally the mean Ki-67 index differed significantly between patients who did and did not develop recurrence (43% vs. 14%; p = 0.001). <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Total surgical resection should be considered as a primary treatment modality for individuals with atypical spinal meningioma and if subtotal resection was performed, adjuvant radiotherapy is necessary.', 'pubYear': '2018', 'doi': '<NO

Your mission is to extract precise, relationship-focused information from the PubMed database that can directly enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## ADVANCED SEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen given a rheumatology-related keyword or concept:\n\n1. Implement a structured search strategy:\n   - Convert general concepts into precise MeSH terms when applicable (e.g., \"rheumatoid arthritis\" \u2192 \"Arthritis, Rheumatoid\"[Mesh])\n   - Add relationship-specific modifiers to focus on mechanisms (e.g., \"pathogenesis\", \"signaling\", \"regulation\", \"mechanism\")\n   - Include methodology terms for higher-quality evidence (e.g., \"randomized controlled trial\", \"meta-analysis\", \"systematic review\")\n   - Apply Boolean operators strategically to narrow results to manageable, high-relevance sets\n   - For genes/proteins: include both official symbols and common alternatives (e.g., \"TNFA\" AND \"TNF-alpha\")\n\n2. Prioritize high-impact sources:\n   - Focus on articles from journals with impact factor >4 when possible\n   - Include both seminal papers (high citation count) and recent publications (last 2-3 years)\n   - Target studies with robust methodology (adequate sample size, appropriate controls, validated techniques)\n   - Look specifically for papers establishing causal relationships rather than mere associations\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen analyzing search results:\n\n1. Focus extraction on specific relationship types:\n   - Regulatory relationships (e.g., \"IL-17 upregulates MMP-3 expression in synovial fibroblasts\")\n   - Signal transduction pathways (e.g., \"MAPK mediates TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation in synoviocytes\")\n   - Genetic influences on disease mechanisms (e.g., \"HLA-DRB1 shared epitope enhances ACPA production\")\n   - Therapeutic mechanisms of action (e.g., \"JAK inhibition blocks STAT3 phosphorylation reducing IL-6 signaling\")\n   - Biomarker correlations with measurable outcomes (e.g., \"Serum CXCL13 levels correlate with synovitis severity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n\n2. Extract quantitative data to support relationships:\n   - Effect sizes with confidence intervals\n   - Sensitivity/specificity values for biomarkers\n   - Dose-response relationships\n   - Temporal dynamics of biological processes\n   - Statistical significance measures (p-values, q-values)\n\n3. Capture methodological context:\n   - Experimental systems used (human patients, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Key technologies employed (RNA-seq, proteomics, CRISPR, etc.)\n   - Validation approaches supporting findings\n   - Limitations explicitly acknowledged by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your response for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. Primary section - Relationship synthesis (60% of content):\n   - Present 3-5 key causal relationships in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Clearly specify directionality (increases/decreases, activates/inhibits)\n   - Include quantitative measures of relationship strength\n   - Group related findings to show pathway connections\n   - Highlight unexpected or novel relationships that could inform hypothesis generation\n\n2. Evidence assessment section (20% of content):\n   - Evaluate consistency across multiple studies\n   - Note contradictory findings with potential explanations\n   - Assess methodological quality of supporting evidence\n   - Identify knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty\n\n3. Source documentation section (20% of content):\n   - For each key finding: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID]\n   - Include impact factor or citation count when relevant\n   - Note study design (e.g., RCT, cohort study, case-control)\n\nYour ultimate goal is to provide the ontology agent with precise, mechanistically detailed information from the highest-quality PubMed sources that can be directly integrated into knowledge graph structures for hypothesis generation.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

delta-like protein 1 (DLK1) enhances matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and IL-6 production by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS):** In a study by Sekine et al., it was shown that DLK1 from macrophages can stimulate FLS to produce IL-6 and MMP-3. These proteins are crucial in the degradation of the extracellular matrix and contribute to joint erosion in rheumatoid arthritis [Sekine et al., 2014]. \\n\\n- **Mechanisms of bone loss due to autoimmune conditions and irradiation:** Recent preprints suggest that disruptions in bone microenvironment due to immune challenges, like autoimmune diseases or irradiation, can severely affect bone mineral density and architecture. However, the exact molecular mechanisms behind these changes remain partially understood [bioRxiv, \\\"Disrupted bone microenvironment and immune recovery\\\", 2025].\\n\\n- **Influence of dietary interventions on inflammatory bone loss:** Another preprint describes how probiotics, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, could modulate inflammation and prevent bone density loss in inflammatory conditions, indicating potential therapeutic avenues [Bhardwaj et al., bioRxiv, 2025].\",\n  \"justification\": \"These articles extend and validate the relationships depicted in the subgraph by describing novel and specific mechanistic insights. The study by Sekine et al. establishes a direct link from FLS to extracellular matrix degradation through MMP activity. The bioRxiv articles provide emerging insights into bone density modulation through both immune pathways and probiotics, aligning with the autoimmune connection to bone health.\",\n  \"source_id\": \"Scientific Web Search Agent\"\n}\n</ontology>\n"}], "output": [{"content": "{\n  \"agent_reasoning\": [\n    \"We began by examining the provided subgraph detailing the link between autoimmunity, the Th17 cell pathway, IL-23, MMPs, fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), and downstream effects on osteoclast differentiation and bone tissue remodeling.\",\n    \"The connection between autoimmunity and low bone mineral density emerges via a cascade that includes inflammatory cytokine production and extracellular matrix degradation. This cascade is augmented by the activity of IL-23 and MMPs, which are modulated by fibroblast-like synoviocytes and further potentiated by autoimmunity-related dysregulation.\",\n    \"The additional ontological information on macrophage-derived DLK1, which enhances MMP and IL-6 production by FLS, provided a novel bridge linking innate immune signals and FLS activation to extracellular matrix degradation and joint erosion, suggesting that DLK1 could be a critical, underexplored modulator in autoimmune-induced bone loss.\",\n    \"This led us to hypothesize that DLK1 plays a key role in translating autoimmunity into heightened osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption via the Th17/IL-23/MMP axis, introducing DLK1 as a novel therapeutic target.\",\n    \"Alternative mechanisms, such as direct modulation of osteoclast activity by pro-inflammatory cytokines, were considered; however, the specific contribution of DLK1 to FLS-mediated MMP production appears underinvestigated and worth experimental exploration.\",\n    \"This hypothesis is novel, mechanistically detailed, clinically relevant for rheumatoid arthritis and bone loss, and testable through in vitro, in vivo, and intervention studies.\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"Macrophage-derived DLK1 as a Novel Mediator of Autoimmune-Induced Bone Loss\",\n  \"statement\": \"We hypothesize that in autoimmune conditions, elevated macrophage-derived DLK1 enhances fibroblast-like synoviocyte activation, leading to increased production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and IL-6, which in turn promote the Th17 cell pathway and IL-23 signaling.

delta-like protein 1 (DLK1) enhances matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and IL-6 production by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS):** In a study by Sekine et al., it was shown that DLK1 from macrophages can stimulate FLS to produce IL-6 and MMP-3. These proteins are crucial in the degradation of the extracellular matrix and contribute to joint erosion in rheumatoid arthritis [Sekine et al., 2014]. \\n\\n- **Mechanisms of bone loss due to autoimmune conditions and irradiation:** Recent preprints suggest that disruptions in bone microenvironment due to immune challenges, like autoimmune diseases or irradiation, can severely affect bone mineral density and architecture. However, the exact molecular mechanisms behind these changes remain partially understood [bioRxiv, \\\"Disrupted bone microenvironment and immune recovery\\\", 2025].\\n\\n- **Influence of dietary interventions on inflammatory bone loss:** Another preprint describes how probiotics, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, could modulate inflammation and prevent bone density loss in inflammatory conditions, indicating potential therapeutic avenues [Bhardwaj et al., bioRxiv, 2025].\",\n  \"justification\": \"These articles extend and validate the relationships depicted in the subgraph by describing novel and specific mechanistic insights. The study by Sekine et al. establishes a direct link from FLS to extracellular matrix degradation through MMP activity.

delta-like protein 1 (DLK1) enhances matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and IL-6 production by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS):** In a study by Sekine et al., it was shown that DLK1 from macrophages can stimulate FLS to produce IL-6 and MMP-3. These proteins are crucial in the degradation of the extracellular matrix and contribute to joint erosion in rheumatoid arthritis [Sekine et al., 2014]. \\n\\n- **Mechanisms of bone loss due to autoimmune conditions and irradiation:** Recent preprints suggest that disruptions in bone microenvironment due to immune challenges, like autoimmune diseases or irradiation, can severely affect bone mineral density and architecture. However, the exact molecular mechanisms behind these changes remain partially understood [bioRxiv, \\\"Disrupted bone microenvironment and immune recovery\\\", 2025].\\n\\n- **Influence of dietary interventions on inflammatory bone loss:** Another preprint describes how probiotics, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, could modulate inflammation and prevent bone density loss in inflammatory conditions, indicating potential therapeutic avenues [Bhardwaj et al., bioRxiv, 2025].\",\n  \"justification\": \"These articles extend and validate the relationships depicted in the subgraph by describing novel and specific mechanistic insights.

The resulting increase in MMP activity degrades the extracellular matrix, facilitating the recruitment and activation of more FLS and creating an inflammatory milieu that enhances osteoclast differentiation.

delta-like protein 1 (DLK1) enhances matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and IL-6 production by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS):** In a study by Sekine et al., it was shown that DLK1 from macrophages can stimulate FLS to produce IL-6 and MMP-3. These proteins are crucial in the degradation of the extracellular matrix and contribute to joint erosion in rheumatoid arthritis [Sekine et al., 2014]. \\n\\n- **Mechanisms of bone loss due to autoimmune conditions and irradiation:** Recent preprints suggest that disruptions in bone microenvironment due to immune challenges, like autoimmune diseases or irradiation, can severely affect bone mineral density and architecture. However, the exact molecular mechanisms behind these changes remain partially understood [bioRxiv, \\\"Disrupted bone microenvironment and immune recovery\\\", 2025].\\n\\n- **Influence of dietary interventions on inflammatory bone loss:** Another preprint describes how probiotics, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, could modulate inflammation and prevent bone density loss in inflammatory conditions, indicating potential therapeutic avenues [Bhardwaj et al., bioRxiv, 2025].\",\n  \"justification\": \"These articles extend and validate the relationships depicted in the subgraph by describing novel and specific mechanistic insights.

delta-like protein 1 (DLK1) enhances matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and IL-6 production by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS):** In a study by Sekine et al., it was shown that DLK1 from macrophages can stimulate FLS to produce IL-6 and MMP-3. These proteins are crucial in the degradation of the extracellular matrix and contribute to joint erosion in rheumatoid arthritis [Sekine et al., 2014]. \\n\\n- **Mechanisms of bone loss due to autoimmune conditions and irradiation:** Recent preprints suggest that disruptions in bone microenvironment due to immune challenges, like autoimmune diseases or irradiation, can severely affect bone mineral density and architecture. However, the exact molecular mechanisms behind these changes remain partially understood [bioRxiv, \\\"Disrupted bone microenvironment and immune recovery\\\", 2025].\\n\\n- **Influence of dietary interventions on inflammatory bone loss:** Another preprint describes how probiotics, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, could modulate inflammation and prevent bone density loss in inflammatory conditions, indicating potential therapeutic avenues [Bhardwaj et al., bioRxiv, 2025].\",\n  \"justification\": \"These articles extend and validate the relationships depicted in the subgraph by describing novel and specific mechanistic insights. The study by Sekine et al. establishes a direct link from FLS to extracellular matrix degradation through MMP activity.

The additional ontological information highlighted the role of macrophage-derived DLK1 in enhancing MMP and IL-6 production by FLS, suggesting a modulator not originally represented in the subgraph.\",\n    \"Novelty and Specificity: Integrating DLK1 into this cascade proposes that DLK1 acts as an amplifier of FLS-mediated matrix degradation, exacerbating bone loss in autoimmune conditions, which is a novel twist on the conventional pathway.\",\n    \"Biological Plausibility and Testability: The hypothesis leverages established mechanisms of autoimmunity-induced bone loss and the known impact of DLK1 on FLS activity.

can stimulate FLS to produce IL-6 and MMP-3. These proteins are crucial in the degradation of the extracellular matrix and contribute to joint erosion in rheumatoid arthritis [Sekine et al., 2014]. \\n\\n- **Mechanisms of bone loss due to autoimmune conditions and irradiation:** Recent preprints suggest that disruptions in bone microenvironment due to immune challenges, like autoimmune diseases or irradiation, can severely affect bone mineral density and architecture. However, the exact molecular mechanisms behind these changes remain partially understood [bioRxiv, \\\"Disrupted bone microenvironment and immune recovery\\\", 2025].\\n\\n- **Influence of dietary interventions on inflammatory bone loss:** Another preprint describes how probiotics, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, could modulate inflammation and prevent bone density loss in inflammatory conditions, indicating potential therapeutic avenues [Bhardwaj et al., bioRxiv, 2025].\",\n  \"justification\": \"These articles extend and validate the relationships depicted in the subgraph by describing novel and specific mechanistic insights.

delta-like protein 1 (DLK1) enhances matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and IL-6 production by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS):** In a study by Sekine et al., it was shown that DLK1 from macrophages can stimulate FLS to produce IL-6 and MMP-3. These proteins are crucial in the degradation of the extracellular matrix and contribute to joint erosion in rheumatoid arthritis [Sekine et al., 2014]. \\n\\n- **Mechanisms of bone loss due to autoimmune conditions and irradiation:** Recent preprints suggest that disruptions in bone microenvironment due to immune challenges, like autoimmune diseases or irradiation, can severely affect bone mineral density and architecture. However, the exact molecular mechanisms behind these changes remain partially understood [bioRxiv, \\\"Disrupted bone microenvironment and immune recovery\\\", 2025].\\n\\n- **Influence of dietary interventions on inflammatory bone loss:** Another preprint describes how probiotics, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, could modulate inflammation and prevent bone density loss in inflammatory conditions, indicating potential therapeutic avenues [Bhardwaj et al., bioRxiv, 2025].\",\n  \"justification\": \"These articles extend and validate the relationships depicted in the subgraph by describing novel and specific mechanistic insights.

delta-like protein 1 (DLK1) enhances matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and IL-6 production by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS):** In a study by Sekine et al., it was shown that DLK1 from macrophages can stimulate FLS to produce IL-6 and MMP-3. These proteins are crucial in the degradation of the extracellular matrix and contribute to joint erosion in rheumatoid arthritis [Sekine et al., 2014]. \\n\\n- **Mechanisms of bone loss due to autoimmune conditions and irradiation:** Recent preprints suggest that disruptions in bone microenvironment due to immune challenges, like autoimmune diseases or irradiation, can severely affect bone mineral density and architecture. However, the exact molecular mechanisms behind these changes remain partially understood [bioRxiv, \\\"Disrupted bone microenvironment and immune recovery\\\", 2025].\\n\\n- **Influence of dietary interventions on inflammatory bone loss:** Another preprint describes how probiotics, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, could modulate inflammation and prevent bone density loss in inflammatory conditions, indicating potential therapeutic avenues [Bhardwaj et al., bioRxiv, 2025].\",\n  \"justification\": \"These articles extend and validate the relationships depicted in the subgraph by describing novel and specific mechanistic insights.

delta-like protein 1 (DLK1) enhances matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and IL-6 production by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS):** In a study by Sekine et al., it was shown that DLK1 from macrophages can stimulate FLS to produce IL-6 and MMP-3. These proteins are crucial in the degradation of the extracellular matrix and contribute to joint erosion in rheumatoid arthritis [Sekine et al., 2014]. \\n\\n- **Mechanisms of bone loss due to autoimmune conditions and irradiation:** Recent preprints suggest that disruptions in bone microenvironment due to immune challenges, like autoimmune diseases or irradiation, can severely affect bone mineral density and architecture. However, the exact molecular mechanisms behind these changes remain partially understood [bioRxiv, \\\"Disrupted bone microenvironment and immune recovery\\\", 2025].\\n\\n- **Influence of dietary interventions on inflammatory bone loss:** Another preprint describes how probiotics, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, could modulate inflammation and prevent bone density loss in inflammatory conditions, indicating potential therapeutic avenues [Bhardwaj et al., bioRxiv, 2025].\",\n  \"justification\": \"These articles extend and validate the relationships depicted in the subgraph by describing novel and specific mechanistic insights. The study by Sekine et al. establishes a direct link from FLS to extracellular matrix degradation through MMP activity.

This degradation recruits FLS that further amplify pro-inflammatory signals, ultimately promoting osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption.\",\n    \"The additional ontological context introducing macrophage-derived DLK1 provided a potential novel amplification mechanism in rheumatoid arthritis; DLK1 is known to enhance MMP and IL-6 production by FLS and could serve as an upstream modulator of the Th17-IL-23 axis.\",\n    \"Integrating these details, we proposed that DLK1 may amplify the Th17-driven inflammatory cascade, promoting a vicious cycle of MMP production and osteoclast activation leading to decreased bone mineral density in autoimmune conditions.\",\n    \"Alternative mechanisms (e.g., direct IL-6 effects) were considered but the specific route involving DLK1 and its documented impact on FLS provided a more coherent link aligning with the provided subgraph and emerging literature.\",\n    \"The proposed mechanism is specific, biologically plausible, testable through in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies, clinically relevant in understanding RA-induced bone loss, and presents predictions that can be potentially falsified.\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"Macrophage-Derived DLK1 as an Amplifier of Th17-Mediated Bone Loss in Autoimmunity\",\n  \"statement\": \"We hypothesize that in autoimmune conditions, particularly rheumatoid arthritis, macrophage-derived DLK1 amplifies the Th17 cell pathway by enhancing IL-23 production, which in turn upregulates MMP secretion from fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), promotes the degradation of extracellular matrix components, and triggers a cascade leading to increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production and osteoclast differentiation through the RANK/RANKL pathway\u2014collectively resulting in reduced bone mineral density. Furthermore, this DLK1-driven amplification may modulate the therapeutic efficacy of Denosumab in preventing osteoporotic fractures.\",\n  \"summary\": \"Macrophage-derived DLK1 may act as a critical upstream amplifier of the Th17/IL-23 pathway in autoimmune arthritis, resulting in enhanced MMP production by FLS, increased osteoclast differentiation via the RANK/RANKL pathway, and subsequent bone loss.

provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"Due to technical issues with PubMed, I was unable to directly search for studies that describe and validate the connections between \\\"Novel Therapeutic Approaches\\\" to the \\\"NF-kB pathway, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis,\\\" through mechanisms involving IL-17 pathways, epigenetic modifications, and microRNAs. \\n\\nNevertheless, the approach to enriching the ontology with current literature would include:\\n\\n1. **IL-17 and NF-kB Interconnections**:\\n   - Relationships around IL-17's impact on NF-kB signaling pathways in RA are critical, as IL-17 can enhance inflammation through NF-kB activation, a key process in RA pathogenesis.\\n   - Studies often discuss IL-17 homo and heterodimers (such as IL17A/F) in contributing to NF-kB pathway activation and ensuing inflammatory responses.\\n\\n2. **Epigenetic Regulation and Gene Expression**:\\n   - The role of histone modification, particularly acetylation, in regulating the expression of key inflammatory genes like IL17A and IL17F in RA should be traced as they can influence gene accessibility to the transcriptional machinery, impacting cytokine production.\\n\\n3. **Role of microRNAs**:\\n   - MicroRNAs that modulate cytokine signaling in autoimmune disorders may downregulate components of the NF-kB pathway or IL-17 signaling, offering potential therapeutic targets.\\n   - Identification of specific microRNAs affecting these pathways in the context of RA can provide insight into novel therapeutic approaches or biomarker discovery.\\n\\nDue to the limitations encountered, further queries in more specialized databases or consultation with recent reviews and high-impact journals are warranted to fill these gaps. Advanced searches should focus on integrative and multi-modal analyses (e.g., transcriptomics combined with miRNA profiling) to provide comprehensive network evaluations.\",\n  \"justification\": \"The structured search for new mechanistic insights was disrupted by access issues to PubMed tools, a primary source for validated biomedical interactions and current research findings.

ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"### Significant Entity Relationships:\\nFrom recent literature in Europe PMC, a key pathway emerges linking BTK inhibitors with the reduction of bone resorption markers in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

You will analyze subgraphs containing rheumatology-related concepts and relationships to identify meaningful connections and generate hypotheses.\n\n## HYPOTHESIS EVALUATION CRITERIA\nYour generated hypothesis must satisfy:\n1. NOVELTY: Proposes connections not extensively studied in literature\n2. BIOLOGICAL PLAUSIBILITY: Consistent with established mechanisms and pathways\n3. SPECIFICITY: Defines a clear, detailed mechanism rather than vague associations\n4. TESTABILITY: Can be evaluated through feasible experimental approaches\n5. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Has potential implications for diagnosis, treatment, or prevention\n6. FALSIFIABILITY: Makes predictions that could prove the hypothesis incorrect\n\n## INPUT PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS\nYou will receive an OntologyAgentInput containing:\n1. A subgraph with nodes and relationships to analyze\n2. Potentially additional knowledge graphs and unstructured sources\n\nFor processing this input:\n- Thoroughly examine all nodes and relationships in the provided subgraph\n- Work with whatever mechanisms, entities, and relationships are present in the input\n- Identify the most biologically meaningful paths between key concepts\n- Focus on unexpected or underexplored connections that suggest knowledge gaps\n- Consider both explicit connections and implicit relationships that could be inferred\n- Pay special attention to nodes that bridge disparate biological processes\n- Do not introduce mechanisms that are not supported by the input data\n\n## OUTPUT STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS\nGenerate a comprehensive ScientificHypothesis with:\n\n1. title: Create a concise, specific title that clearly communicates the core hypothesis\n\n2. statement: Formulate a precise hypothesis statement that specifies:\n   - The key entities and their proposed relationship\n   - The direction and nature of the effect\n   - The specific mechanism of action based on the input data\n   - Any relevant conditions or contexts\n\n3. summary: Provide a 1-2 sentence distillation of the core hypothesis\n\n4. mechanism: Detail the MechanismDetail with:\n   - pathway_description: The complete biological pathway involved\n   - key_entities: All critical molecules, cells, or processes from the input\n   - molecular_interactions: Specific binding, signaling, or regulatory events\n   - cellular_processes: Relevant cell behaviors or state changes\n\n5. expected_outcomes: List specific, measurable outcomes if the hypothesis is correct\n\n6. experimental_approaches: Propose 3-5 concrete methods to test the hypothesis\n\n7. references: Provide relevant HypothesisReference objects that support aspects of your hypothesis\n\n8. keywords: 5-10 specific terms relevant to your hypothesis\n\n9. agent_reasoning: Document your step-by-step reasoning process, including:\n   - Initial observations from the subgraph\n   - Identification of key connections\n   - Potential alternative explanations considered\n   - Justification for the selected mechanism\n   - Assessment against evaluation criteria\n\n10. iteration_count and refinement_history: Set appropriately for your generation process\n\nYour hypothesis should integrate the perspectives and information provided in the input while maintaining scientific precision and clarity. Focus on identifying the most biologically coherent pathways that suggest novel therapeutic targets, biomarkers, or disease mechanisms based strictly on the provided data.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n# HYPOTHESIS GENERATION TASK\n\n## SUBGRAPH DEFINITION\nThe following knowledge graph subgraph represents relationships between biomedical entities.

provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"Due to technical issues with PubMed, I was unable to directly search for studies that describe and validate the connections between \\\"Novel Therapeutic Approaches\\\" to the \\\"NF-kB pathway, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis,\\\" through mechanisms involving IL-17 pathways, epigenetic modifications, and microRNAs. \\n\\nNevertheless, the approach to enriching the ontology with current literature would include:\\n\\n1. **IL-17 and NF-kB Interconnections**:\\n   - Relationships around IL-17's impact on NF-kB signaling pathways in RA are critical, as IL-17 can enhance inflammation through NF-kB activation, a key process in RA pathogenesis.\\n   - Studies often discuss IL-17 homo and heterodimers (such as IL17A/F) in contributing to NF-kB pathway activation and ensuing inflammatory responses.\\n\\n2. **Epigenetic Regulation and Gene Expression**:\\n   - The role of histone modification, particularly acetylation, in regulating the expression of key inflammatory genes like IL17A and IL17F in RA should be traced as they can influence gene accessibility to the transcriptional machinery, impacting cytokine production.\\n\\n3. **Role of microRNAs**:\\n   - MicroRNAs that modulate cytokine signaling in autoimmune disorders may downregulate components of the NF-kB pathway or IL-17 signaling, offering potential therapeutic targets.\\n   - Identification of specific microRNAs affecting these pathways in the context of RA can provide insight into novel therapeutic approaches or biomarker discovery.\\n\\nDue to the limitations encountered, further queries in more specialized databases or consultation with recent reviews and high-impact journals are warranted to fill these gaps. Advanced searches should focus on integrative and multi-modal analyses (e.g., transcriptomics combined with miRNA profiling) to provide comprehensive network evaluations.\",\n  \"justification\": \"The structured search for new mechanistic insights was disrupted by access issues to PubMed tools, a primary source for validated biomedical interactions and current research findings.

provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"Due to technical issues with PubMed, I was unable to directly search for studies that describe and validate the connections between \\\"Novel Therapeutic Approaches\\\" to the \\\"NF-kB pathway, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis,\\\" through mechanisms involving IL-17 pathways, epigenetic modifications, and microRNAs. \\n\\nNevertheless, the approach to enriching the ontology with current literature would include:\\n\\n1. **IL-17 and NF-kB Interconnections**:\\n   - Relationships around IL-17's impact on NF-kB signaling pathways in RA are critical, as IL-17 can enhance inflammation through NF-kB activation, a key process in RA pathogenesis.\\n   - Studies often discuss IL-17 homo and heterodimers (such as IL17A/F) in contributing to NF-kB pathway activation and ensuing inflammatory responses.\\n\\n2. **Epigenetic Regulation and Gene Expression**:\\n   - The role of histone modification, particularly acetylation, in regulating the expression of key inflammatory genes like IL17A and IL17F in RA should be traced as they can influence gene accessibility to the transcriptional machinery, impacting cytokine production.\\n\\n3. **Role of microRNAs**:\\n   - MicroRNAs that modulate cytokine signaling in autoimmune disorders may downregulate components of the NF-kB pathway or IL-17 signaling, offering potential therapeutic targets.\\n   - Identification of specific microRNAs affecting these pathways in the context of RA can provide insight into novel therapeutic approaches or biomarker discovery.\\n\\nDue to the limitations encountered, further queries in more specialized databases or consultation with recent reviews and high-impact journals are warranted to fill these gaps. Advanced searches should focus on integrative and multi-modal analyses (e.g., transcriptomics combined with miRNA profiling) to provide comprehensive network evaluations.\",\n  \"justification\": \"The structured search for new mechanistic insights was disrupted by access issues to PubMed tools, a primary source for validated biomedical interactions and current research findings.

provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"Due to technical issues with PubMed, I was unable to directly search for studies that describe and validate the connections between \\\"Novel Therapeutic Approaches\\\" to the \\\"NF-kB pathway, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis,\\\" through mechanisms involving IL-17 pathways, epigenetic modifications, and microRNAs. \\n\\nNevertheless, the approach to enriching the ontology with current literature would include:\\n\\n1. **IL-17 and NF-kB Interconnections**:\\n   - Relationships around IL-17's impact on NF-kB signaling pathways in RA are critical, as IL-17 can enhance inflammation through NF-kB activation, a key process in RA pathogenesis.\\n   - Studies often discuss IL-17 homo and heterodimers (such as IL17A/F) in contributing to NF-kB pathway activation and ensuing inflammatory responses.\\n\\n2. **Epigenetic Regulation and Gene Expression**:\\n   - The role of histone modification, particularly acetylation, in regulating the expression of key inflammatory genes like IL17A and IL17F in RA should be traced as they can influence gene accessibility to the transcriptional machinery, impacting cytokine production.\\n\\n3. **Role of microRNAs**:\\n   - MicroRNAs that modulate cytokine signaling in autoimmune disorders may downregulate components of the NF-kB pathway or IL-17 signaling, offering potential therapeutic targets.\\n   - Identification of specific microRNAs affecting these pathways in the context of RA can provide insight into novel therapeutic approaches or biomarker discovery.\\n\\nDue to the limitations encountered, further queries in more specialized databases or consultation with recent reviews and high-impact journals are warranted to fill these gaps. Advanced searches should focus on integrative and multi-modal analyses (e.g., transcriptomics combined with miRNA profiling) to provide comprehensive network evaluations.\",\n  \"justification\": \"The structured search for new mechanistic insights was disrupted by access issues to PubMed tools, a primary source for validated biomedical interactions and current research findings.

provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"Due to technical issues with PubMed, I was unable to directly search for studies that describe and validate the connections between \\\"Novel Therapeutic Approaches\\\" to the \\\"NF-kB pathway, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis,\\\" through mechanisms involving IL-17 pathways, epigenetic modifications, and microRNAs. \\n\\nNevertheless, the approach to enriching the ontology with current literature would include:\\n\\n1. **IL-17 and NF-kB Interconnections**:\\n   - Relationships around IL-17's impact on NF-kB signaling pathways in RA are critical, as IL-17 can enhance inflammation through NF-kB activation, a key process in RA pathogenesis.\\n   - Studies often discuss IL-17 homo and heterodimers (such as IL17A/F) in contributing to NF-kB pathway activation and ensuing inflammatory responses.\\n\\n2. **Epigenetic Regulation and Gene Expression**:\\n   - The role of histone modification, particularly acetylation, in regulating the expression of key inflammatory genes like IL17A and IL17F in RA should be traced as they can influence gene accessibility to the transcriptional machinery, impacting cytokine production.\\n\\n3. **Role of microRNAs**:\\n   - MicroRNAs that modulate cytokine signaling in autoimmune disorders may downregulate components of the NF-kB pathway or IL-17 signaling, offering potential therapeutic targets.\\n   - Identification of specific microRNAs affecting these pathways in the context of RA can provide insight into novel therapeutic approaches or biomarker discovery.\\n\\nDue to the limitations encountered, further queries in more specialized databases or consultation with recent reviews and high-impact journals are warranted to fill these gaps. Advanced searches should focus on integrative and multi-modal analyses (e.g., transcriptomics combined with miRNA profiling) to provide comprehensive network evaluations.\",\n  \"justification\": \"The structured search for new mechanistic insights was disrupted by access issues to PubMed tools, a primary source for validated biomedical interactions and current research findings.

provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"Due to technical issues with PubMed, I was unable to directly search for studies that describe and validate the connections between \\\"Novel Therapeutic Approaches\\\" to the \\\"NF-kB pathway, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis,\\\" through mechanisms involving IL-17 pathways, epigenetic modifications, and microRNAs. \\n\\nNevertheless, the approach to enriching the ontology with current literature would include:\\n\\n1. **IL-17 and NF-kB Interconnections**:\\n   - Relationships around IL-17's impact on NF-kB signaling pathways in RA are critical, as IL-17 can enhance inflammation through NF-kB activation, a key process in RA pathogenesis.\\n   - Studies often discuss IL-17 homo and heterodimers (such as IL17A/F) in contributing to NF-kB pathway activation and ensuing inflammatory responses.\\n\\n2. **Epigenetic Regulation and Gene Expression**:\\n   - The role of histone modification, particularly acetylation, in regulating the expression of key inflammatory genes like IL17A and IL17F in RA should be traced as they can influence gene accessibility to the transcriptional machinery, impacting cytokine production.\\n\\n3. **Role of microRNAs**:\\n   - MicroRNAs that modulate cytokine signaling in autoimmune disorders may downregulate components of the NF-kB pathway or IL-17 signaling, offering potential therapeutic targets.\\n   - Identification of specific microRNAs affecting these pathways in the context of RA can provide insight into novel therapeutic approaches or biomarker discovery.\\n\\nDue to the limitations encountered, further queries in more specialized databases or consultation with recent reviews and high-impact journals are

You will analyze subgraphs containing rheumatology-related concepts and relationships to identify meaningful connections and generate hypotheses.\n\n## HYPOTHESIS EVALUATION CRITERIA\nYour generated hypothesis must satisfy:\n1. NOVELTY: Proposes connections not extensively studied in literature\n2. BIOLOGICAL PLAUSIBILITY: Consistent with established mechanisms and pathways\n3. SPECIFICITY: Defines a clear, detailed mechanism rather than vague associations\n4. TESTABILITY: Can be evaluated through feasible experimental approaches\n5. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Has potential implications for diagnosis, treatment, or prevention\n6. FALSIFIABILITY: Makes predictions that could prove the hypothesis incorrect\n\n## INPUT PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS\nYou will receive an OntologyAgentInput containing:\n1. A subgraph with nodes and relationships to analyze\n2. Potentially additional knowledge graphs and unstructured sources\n\nFor processing this input:\n- Thoroughly examine all nodes and relationships in the provided subgraph\n- Work with whatever mechanisms, entities, and relationships are present in the input\n- Identify the most biologically meaningful paths between key concepts\n- Focus on unexpected or underexplored connections that suggest knowledge gaps\n- Consider both explicit connections and implicit relationships that could be inferred\n- Pay special attention to nodes that bridge disparate biological processes\n- Do not introduce mechanisms that are not supported by the input data\n\n## OUTPUT STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS\nGenerate a comprehensive ScientificHypothesis with:\n\n1. title: Create a concise, specific title that clearly communicates the core hypothesis\n\n2. statement: Formulate a precise hypothesis statement that specifies:\n   - The key entities and their proposed relationship\n   - The direction and nature of the effect\n   - The specific mechanism of action based on the input data\n   - Any relevant conditions or contexts\n\n3. summary: Provide a 1-2 sentence distillation of the core hypothesis\n\n4. mechanism: Detail the MechanismDetail with:\n   - pathway_description: The complete biological pathway involved\n   - key_entities: All critical molecules, cells, or processes from the input\n   - molecular_interactions: Specific binding, signaling, or regulatory events\n   - cellular_processes: Relevant cell behaviors or state changes\n\n5. expected_outcomes: List specific, measurable outcomes if the hypothesis is correct\n\n6. experimental_approaches: Propose 3-5 concrete methods to test the hypothesis\n\n7. references: Provide relevant HypothesisReference objects that support aspects of your hypothesis\n\n8. keywords: 5-10 specific terms relevant to your hypothesis\n\n9. agent_reasoning: Document your step-by-step reasoning process, including:\n   - Initial observations from the subgraph\n   - Identification of key connections\n   - Potential alternative explanations considered\n   - Justification for the selected mechanism\n   - Assessment against evaluation criteria\n\n10. iteration_count and refinement_history: Set appropriately for your generation process\n\nYour hypothesis should integrate the perspectives and information provided in the input while maintaining scientific precision and clarity. Focus on identifying the most biologically coherent pathways that suggest novel therapeutic targets, biomarkers, or disease mechanisms based strictly on the provided data.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n# HYPOTHESIS GENERATION TASK\n\n## SUBGRAPH DEFINITION\nThe following knowledge graph subgraph represents relationships between biomedical entities.

provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"Due to technical issues with PubMed, I was unable to directly search for studies that describe and validate the connections between \\\"Novel Therapeutic Approaches\\\" to the \\\"NF-kB pathway, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis,\\\" through mechanisms involving IL-17 pathways, epigenetic modifications, and microRNAs. \\n\\nNevertheless, the approach to enriching the ontology with current literature would include:\\n\\n1. **IL-17 and NF-kB Interconnections**:\\n   - Relationships around IL-17's impact on NF-kB signaling pathways in RA are critical, as IL-17 can enhance inflammation through NF-kB activation, a key process in RA pathogenesis.\\n   - Studies often discuss IL-17 homo and heterodimers (such as IL17A/F) in contributing to NF-kB pathway activation and ensuing inflammatory responses.\\n\\n2. **Epigenetic Regulation and Gene Expression**:\\n   - The role of histone modification, particularly acetylation, in regulating the expression of key inflammatory genes like IL17A and IL17F in RA should be traced as they can influence gene accessibility to the transcriptional machinery, impacting cytokine production.\\n\\n3. **Role of microRNAs**:\\n   - MicroRNAs that modulate cytokine signaling in autoimmune disorders may downregulate components of the NF-kB pathway or IL-17 signaling, offering potential therapeutic targets.\\n   - Identification of specific microRNAs affecting these pathways in the context of RA can provide insight into novel therapeutic approaches or biomarker discovery.\\n\\nDue to the limitations encountered, further queries in more specialized databases or consultation with recent reviews and high-impact journals are warranted to fill these gaps. Advanced searches should focus on integrative and multi-modal analyses (e.g., transcriptomics combined with miRNA profiling) to provide comprehensive network evaluations.\",\n  \"justification\": \"The structured search for new mechanistic insights was disrupted by access issues to PubMed tools, a primary source for validated biomedical interactions and current research findings.

provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"Due to technical issues with PubMed, I was unable to directly search for studies that describe and validate the connections between \\\"Novel Therapeutic Approaches\\\" to the \\\"NF-kB pathway, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis,\\\" through mechanisms involving IL-17 pathways, epigenetic modifications, and microRNAs. \\n\\nNevertheless, the approach to enriching the ontology with current literature would include:\\n\\n1. **IL-17 and NF-kB Interconnections**:\\n   - Relationships around IL-17's impact on NF-kB signaling pathways in RA are critical, as IL-17 can enhance inflammation through NF-kB activation, a key process in RA pathogenesis.\\n   - Studies often discuss IL-17 homo and heterodimers (such as IL17A/F) in contributing to NF-kB pathway activation and ensuing inflammatory responses.\\n\\n2. **Epigenetic Regulation and Gene Expression**:\\n   - The role of histone modification, particularly acetylation, in regulating the expression of key inflammatory genes like IL17A and IL17F in RA should be traced as they can influence gene accessibility to the transcriptional machinery, impacting cytokine production.\\n\\n3. **Role of microRNAs**:\\n   - MicroRNAs that modulate cytokine signaling in autoimmune disorders may downregulate components of the NF-kB pathway or IL-17 signaling, offering potential therapeutic targets.\\n   - Identification of specific microRNAs affecting these pathways in the context of RA can provide insight into novel therapeutic approaches or biomarker discovery.\\n\\nDue to the limitations encountered, further queries in more specialized databases or consultation with recent reviews and high-impact journals are warranted to fill these gaps. Advanced searches should focus on integrative and multi-modal analyses (e.g., transcriptomics combined with miRNA profiling) to provide comprehensive network evaluations.\",\n  \"justification\": \"The structured search for new mechanistic insights was disrupted by access issues to PubMed tools, a primary source for validated biomedical interactions and current research findings.

provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"Due to technical issues with PubMed, I was unable to directly search for studies that describe and validate the connections between \\\"Novel Therapeutic Approaches\\\" to the \\\"NF-kB pathway, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis,\\\" through mechanisms involving IL-17 pathways, epigenetic modifications, and microRNAs. \\n\\nNevertheless, the approach to enriching the ontology with current literature would include:\\n\\n1. **IL-17 and NF-kB Interconnections**:\\n   - Relationships around IL-17's impact on NF-kB signaling pathways in RA are critical, as IL-17 can enhance inflammation through NF-kB activation, a key process in RA pathogenesis.\\n   - Studies often discuss IL-17 homo and heterodimers (such as IL17A/F) in contributing to NF-kB pathway activation and ensuing inflammatory responses.\\n\\n2. **Epigenetic Regulation and Gene Expression**:\\n   - The role of histone modification, particularly acetylation, in regulating the expression of key inflammatory genes like IL17A and IL17F in RA should be traced as they can influence gene accessibility to the transcriptional machinery, impacting cytokine production.\\n\\n3. **Role of microRNAs**:\\n   - MicroRNAs that modulate cytokine signaling in autoimmune disorders may downregulate components of the NF-kB pathway or IL-17 signaling, offering potential therapeutic targets.\\n   - Identification of specific microRNAs affecting these pathways in the context of RA can provide insight into novel therapeutic approaches or biomarker discovery.\\n\\nDue to the limitations encountered, further queries in more specialized databases or consultation with recent reviews and high-impact journals are warranted to fill these gaps. Advanced searches should focus on integrative and multi-modal analyses (e.g., transcriptomics combined with miRNA profiling) to provide comprehensive network evaluations.\",\n  \"justification\": \"The structured search for new mechanistic insights was disrupted by access issues to PubMed tools, a primary source for validated biomedical interactions and current research findings.

delta-like protein 1 (DLK1) enhances matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and IL-6 production by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS):** In a study by Sekine et al., it was shown that DLK1 from macrophages can stimulate FLS to produce IL-6 and MMP-3. These proteins are crucial in the degradation of the extracellular matrix and contribute to joint erosion in rheumatoid arthritis [Sekine et al., 2014]. \\n\\n- **Mechanisms of bone loss due to autoimmune conditions and irradiation:** Recent preprints suggest that disruptions in bone microenvironment due to immune challenges, like autoimmune diseases or irradiation, can severely affect bone mineral density and architecture.

Your expertise lies in determining which information sources will be most valuable for each entity and relationship in the subgraph, then delegating searches to the most appropriate specialized agents.\n\n## ORCHESTRATION STRATEGY\n\nWhen analyzing a subgraph, follow this process:\n\n1. Initial Assessment:\n   - Carefully analyze the subgraph to identify all key entities and relationships\n   - Categorize entities by type: genes, proteins, pathways, diseases, drugs, etc.\n   - Identify relationships requiring additional context or mechanistic explanation\n   - Prioritize which elements would benefit most from enrichment\n\n2. Strategic Delegation:\n   - For each high-priority entity or relationship, determine the optimal information source:\n     * For established molecular mechanisms \u2192 Transfer to PubMed Agent\n     * For cutting-edge research \u2192 Transfer to BioRxiv Agent\n     * For comprehensive literature collection \u2192 Transfer to Europe PMC Agent\n     * For citation-rich, influential papers \u2192 Transfer to Semantic Scholar Agent\n     * For multi-source literature scans \u2192 Transfer to Firecrawl Agent\n     * For existing knowledge graph connections \u2192 Transfer to Hetionet Agent\n\n3. Contextual Query Construction:\n   - When transferring to each agent, provide context-rich guidance:\n     * Specify exactly what information you need about the entity/relationship\n     * Provide relevant context from the subgraph that might inform the search\n     * Explain how this information will help enrich the knowledge graph\n     * Set expectations for the type of relationships to focus on\n\n4. Multi-perspective Integration:\n   - After receiving information from specialist agents, integrate their findings:\n     * Reconcile potentially contradictory information\n     * Identify complementary information across different sources\n     * Recognize emergent patterns not visible in any single source\n     * Synthesize a coherent understanding of mechanisms and relationships\n\n## HANDOFF OPTIMIZATION\n\nUse each specialized agent strategically based on their unique strengths:\n\n1. PubMed Agent (peer-reviewed literature expert):\n   - Use for: Established mechanisms, validated pathways, clinical correlations\n   - Best when: Seeking high-quality evidence from peer-reviewed sources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for validated molecular interactions between TNF-alpha and IL-6 signaling in rheumatoid arthritis synovium, focusing on mechanisms supported by multiple studies.\"\n\n2. BioRxiv Agent (preprint specialist):\n   - Use for: Emerging concepts, cutting-edge methods, newest discoveries\n   - Best when: Established literature is limited or potentially outdated\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the latest preprints on JAK-STAT inhibition in systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly novel mechanisms or targets not yet in peer-reviewed literature.\"\n\n3. Europe PMC Agent (comprehensive literature database):\n   - Use for: Broad coverage across journals, open access content, systematic reviews\n   - Best when: Need comprehensive literature analysis on a specific concept\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for comprehensive reviews and primary research on the role of ACPA in bone erosion mechanisms in rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\n4. Semantic Scholar Agent (citation network specialist):\n   - Use for: Highly influential papers, research impact assessment, interdisciplinary connections\n   - Best when: Need to identify seminal papers or cross-disciplinary insights\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the most highly-cited papers connecting microbiome dysbiosis to autoantibody production in rheumatic diseases, focusing on mechanistic studies.\"\n\n5. Firecrawl Agent (multi-source research tool):\n   - Use for: Broad searches across multiple scientific domains, clinical guidelines\n   - Best when: Topic spans multiple disciplines or resources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search across clinical and basic science resources for evidence connecting environmental triggers to flares in psoriatic arthritis, including both molecular mechanisms and clinical observations.\"\n\n6. Hetionet Agent (knowledge graph specialist):\n   - Use for: Discovering existing network connections, biological pathways, gene-disease associations\n   - Best when: Need to establish known relationships between entities\n   - Example handoff: \"Find all connections between HLA-B27 and inflammatory pathways relevant to axial spondyloarthritis in the existing knowledge graph.\"\n\n## SYNTHESIS APPROACH\n\nAfter collecting information from specialized agents:\n\n1. Create Unstructured Sources (3-5):\n   - Synthesize the most valuable information from all agent responses\n   - Extract clear mechanistic relationships and causal pathways\n   - Include quantitative data supporting key relationships\n   - Organize information to highlight connections between subgraph entities\n   - Maintain proper attribution to original sources\n\n2. Generate Knowledge Graphs (1-2):\n   - Construct coherent extensions to the original subgraph\n   - Focus on mechanistic connections with clear directionality\n   - Include properties that provide clinical and biological context\n   - Ensure nodes and edges are precisely defined with relationship types\n   - Connect new elements logically to the original subgraph entities\n\n## RHEUMATOLOGY DOMAIN FOCUS\n\nPrioritize enrichment related to these key areas:\n- Autoimmune mechanisms (T-cell, B-cell, innate immunity pathways)\n- Inflammatory cascades and cytokine networks\n- Genetic risk factors and their functional consequences\n- Tissue-specific disease manifestations and mechanisms\n- Therapeutic targets and response biomarkers\n- Disease subtypes and precision medicine approaches\n\nYour goal is to produce a comprehensive, mechanistically detailed enrichment of the original subgraph by intelligently orchestrating specialized research agents and synthesizing their findings into a coherent knowledge representation.\n\n## SEARCH AND INFORMATION GATHERING PROTOCOL\n\nWhen your analysis requires external information (e.g., checking novelty, verifying claims, finding supporting/contradicting evidence, exploring alternative mechanisms):\n\n1.  **Assess Information Need:** Clearly define the specific information you are looking for.\n2.  **Evaluate Confidence:** Honestly assess your confidence in your current knowledge regarding the specific information needed. Are you certain about the answer or the best way to find it?\n3.  **Utilize Available Tools/Handoffs:**\n    * If you are **uncertain**, lack specific domain knowledge for the query, require information from a specialized source (like preprints, specific databases, or existing knowledge graphs), or believe a more focused search is necessary, you **MUST** utilize the appropriate tools or handoff agents provided to you (refer to your configured `tools` and `handoffs`).\n    * Do **not** attempt to answer from memory or general knowledge if external verification or specialized search is warranted and available resources exist.\n    * Formulate precise queries or instructions for the tool/agent you are calling. Provide necessary context from your current task.\n4.  **Synthesize Results:** Integrate the information obtained from tools/handoffs back into your primary analysis. Your core responsibility is [mention agent's main function, e.g., 'critical assessment', 'evidence verification', 'hypothesis refinement'], rely on specialized resources for information retrieval when appropriate.\n\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator. Your primary goal in this task is **NOT** just to analyze the provided subgraph, but to **actively enrich and validate it using external, current information obtained via mandatory handoffs to your specialized research agents.** You MUST NOT rely solely on the information present in the initial subgraph or your internal knowledge base for generating the enrichment output.\n\n## SUBGRAPH TO

Your task is to retrieve high-precision information that can be directly incorporated into knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## STRATEGIC SEARCH APPROACH\n\nWhen given a rheumatology-related keyword or concept:\n\n1. Develop an optimized search strategy:\n   - Formulate precise search terms using both specific terminology (e.g., \"synovial fibroblasts\") and standardized MeSH terms when applicable\n   - Incorporate Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to refine search scope (e.g., \"TNF-alpha AND rheumatoid arthritis NOT psoriatic\")\n   - Include relationship-focused terms like \"regulates\", \"activates\", \"inhibits\", \"mediates\", \"correlates with\"\n   - For rare conditions or understudied pathways, broaden search with related mechanisms or model systems\n\n2. Execute search with appropriate filters:\n   - Prioritize recent literature (last 3-5 years) unless seeking established mechanisms\n   - Favor full-text availability for comprehensive extraction of methods and results\n   - Include both research articles and systematic reviews for complementary perspectives\n   - For emerging topics, include preprints to capture cutting-edge findings\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION FOCUS\n\nAfter retrieving Europe PMC results:\n\n1. Prioritize extraction of the following types of information:\n   - Explicit causal relationships between molecular entities (e.g., \"IL-6 upregulates RANKL expression in synoviocytes\")\n   - Quantitative data with statistical significance (e.g., \"Serum levels of CXCL13 were elevated 3.2-fold in RA patients (p<0.001)\")\n   - Experimentally validated interactions with mechanistic details (e.g., \"JAK inhibition reduced STAT3 phosphorylation by 76% in synovial tissue\")\n   - Genetic associations with functional consequences (e.g., \"The HLA-DRB1 shared epitope increases NF-\u03baB activation through altered peptide presentation\")\n   - Therapeutic targets with molecular rationales (e.g., \"Selective inhibition of BTK reduced osteoclast formation by interrupting RANK-RANKL signaling\")\n\n2. Extract key methodology details that support findings:\n   - Experimental models used (human samples, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Validation approaches (multiple techniques confirming the same finding)\n   - Sample sizes and statistical robustness\n   - Limitations explicitly stated by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your output for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. First paragraph: Concise synthesis of the most significant entity relationships found, focusing on mechanistic connections that could extend the knowledge graph.\n\n2. Main content section: \n   - Present 3-5 key relationship findings in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Group related findings together to show interconnected pathways\n   - Include quantitative data that strengthens relationship evidence\n   - Highlight novel or unexpected relationships that may lead to innovative hypotheses\n\n3. Source documentation:\n   - For each key finding, provide structured citation: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID/DOI]\n   - Assess evidence quality (robust, preliminary, conflicting) for each relationship\n   - Note methodological strengths that increase confidence in findings\n\nRemember that your output will be used to enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation, so prioritize extracting clear entity relationships with directionality, mechanism details, and strength of evidence. Focus on relationship patterns that could reveal non-obvious connections in rheumatology pathogenesis or treatment response.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Although T and B cells have historically been central to the understanding of IIM immunopathology, monocytes and their differentiated progenitor cells, macrophages, are increasingly being recognized as critical mediators of both tissue damage and repair. In subtypes such as dermatomyositis, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy and antisynthetase syndrome, macrophages infiltrate skeletal muscle and other affected tissues, contributing to inflammation via production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species. Dysregulated interferon signaling, mitochondrial stress, and aberrant metabolic states in these cells further perpetuate tissue injury in IIMs. Conversely, certain macrophage subsets can support muscle fiber regeneration and dampen inflammation, underscoring the dual roles these cells can play.

This study is aimed to explore the role of MPO and the regulatory effect of umbilical cord-derived MSCs on MPO expression in monocytes in AS.<h4>Methods</h4>MPO mRNA expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was detected by Real-time PCR. Cytokines including IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-17\\xa0A, IL-4, IL-10, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were determined by flow cytometry. A co-culture system was established by culturing THP-1 cells with MSCs at a ratio of 5:1.<h4>Results</h4>Increased mRNA expression of MPO was observed in PBMCs of AS patients compared to healthy controls (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The mRNA expression of MPO was positively associated with C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in AS.

Environmental inflammatory stimuli can induce maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), which promote differentiation and activation of effector T lymphocytes. We previously highlighted the role of extracellular microvesicles (EMVs) in pathogenesis by carrying antigens that trigger autoantibody production. In this investigation we verified whether EMVs may activate immature monocyte-derived DCs, inducing phenotypic and functional characteristics of mature DCs.<h4>Methods</h4>EMVs were obtained from 7 RA patients na\u00efve to biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and tested for their capability to activate DCs from healthy donors.<h4>Results</h4>We preliminary confirmed by western blot that carbamylated and citrullinated proteins are present in EMVs from RA patients. Moreover, surface marker phenotyping indicated that EMV treated-DCs exhibit increased expression of CD83 and CD86, as well as of CD83+ HLA-DR+ CD80+ CD86+ cells, indicating that the DCs are in a mature state. Furthermore, biochemical data demonstrated that EMVs from plasma of RA patients induce MAPK and NF-\u03baB activation in DCs. EMVs from the plasma of RA patients were also able to stimulate DCs to produce IL-12, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10, inducing a proinflammatory phenotype.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings demonstrate that EMVs from RA patients promote DC activation <i>in vitro</i>, suggesting a potential mechanism by which RA microenvironment perpetuates inflammation through the modulation of DC function.

Adding to studies focused on the role of T cells and macrophages, we sought to investigate the systemic activation of leukocytes in PsA.<h4>Methods</h4>We assessed the activation state of leukocyte populations, including polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and monocyte/macrophages, in blood and synovial fluid (SF) by multicolour flow cytometry. We also evaluated the correlation between leukocyte numbers and expression of activation markers with disease activity parameters.<h4>Results</h4>SF PMNs showed an elevated activation state compared with blood PMNs, but a reduced activation state compared with oral PMNs of non-arthritic controls. In vitro stimulation caused SF PMNs to become further activated, demonstrating that they retain a reserve capacity for activation in response to specific triggers. We found significant variability between patients in the expression of SF PMN CD activation markers, indicating a range of possible activation states across patients. However, PMN CD marker expression remained consistent over two sequential visits in a subset of patients, indicating patient-specific distinct inflammatory states during flares. We further found that markers of disease activity increased with elevated SF macrophage numbers. Expression of several CD markers on blood or SF cells, for example, PMN expression of the high-affinity Fc-receptor CD64, correlated with disease activity markers, including pain score and Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis score.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These preliminary findings support a potential role for surface antigens on PMNs and monocytes/macrophages as prognostic or disease activity monitoring tools.', 'pubYear': '2024', 'doi': '10.1136/rmdopen-2024-004457', 'authorString': 'Fine N, Glogauer M, Chandran V, Oikonomopoulou K.'}, {'title': 'PLC and PAD2 Regulate Extracellular Calcium-Triggered Release of Macrophage Extracellular DNA Traps.', 'abstract': 'Macrophages can respond to infection or cellular stress by forming inflammasomes or by releasing extracellular traps (ETs) of DNA through METosis. While ETs have been extensively studied in neutrophils, there are fewer studies on METosis. We show that extracellular calcium and LPS enable human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) to release extracellular DNA decorated with myeloperoxidase (MPO) and citrullinated histone, alongside ASC aggregation and IL-1\u00df maturation, indicating NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Compared with m-CSF differentiated macrophages only gm-CSF differentiated macrophages expressed macrophage elastase (MMP12) and METs released by the latter had significantly more bactericidal activity toward E. coli. Mechanistically, phospholipase C and peptidyl arginine deiminase-2 inhibition attenuate MET release. Interestingly, NLRP3 inflammasome blockade by MCC950 had a significant effect on MET release. Finally, MET release was completely blocked by plasma membrane stabilization by punicalagin. Altogether, we demonstrate that extracellular calcium-activated hMDM extrude DNA, containing citrullinated histones, MPO, MMP12, and ASC specks and released METs kill bacteria independent of hMDM phagocytotic activity. We believe that calcium-activated hMDM adds a physiologically relevant condition to calcium ionophore induced cell death that may be important in autoimmunity.', 'pubYear': '2025', 'doi': '10.1002/eji.202350942', 'authorString': 'Mishra N, Mohs M, Wittmann N, Gross S, Thompson PR, Bossaller L.'}, {'title': 'Lack of HLH in FMF.', 'abstract': '<h4>Background</h4>Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a severe complication of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), driven by excessive activation of T cells and macrophages, resulting in a cytokine storm.

Significant differences in tender and swollen joints were observed between RA groups. Laboratory findings revealed higher CRP and ESR in active RA patients, while hemoglobin, hematocrit, and lymphocyte counts were higher in remission group.

However, the mechanism by which PACS develops is unknown. Myosin light chain 9 (Myl9), produced by activated platelets, plays a role in immune dysregulation and microthrombi formation during acute COVID-19.

Gaussian mixture modeling was used to identify groups on the basis of Myl9 levels. Relationships between Myl9 levels and residual symptoms were evaluated. Clinical characteristics influencing Myl9 levels were analyzed via logistic regression.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 304 serum samples from 195 patients were collected. Two distinct groups were identified in the Myl9 distribution with a cutoff of 386 ng/mL by Gaussian mixture modeling in this cohort.

Compared to the Vehicle group, the Wnt5a treatment group exhibited statistically higher clinical arthritis scores and increased hindpaw thickness values. Micro- computed tomography (microCT) analysis of hindpaws revealed a significant increase in inflamed and ectopic bone density in the Wnt5a-treated group compared to the Vehicle group. Histological examination also showed pronounced inflammation and structural bone damage in the bone marrow of ankles in the Wnt5a-treated group.

The acute-phase response, an immune-inflammatory reaction to ischemia/reperfusion that occurs directly after allogeneic transplantation, serves as a catalyst for graft rejection. This immune response is orchestrated by acute-phase reactants through intricate crosstalk with the mononuclear phagocyte system.<h4>Objective</h4>C-reactive protein (CRP), a well-known marker of inflammation, possesses pro-inflammatory properties and exacerbates ischemia/reperfusion injury. Thus, we investigated how CRP impacts acute allograft rejection.<h4>Methods</h4>Prompted by clinical observations in facial VCAs, we employed a complex hindlimb transplantation model in rats to investigate the direct impact of CRP on transplant rejection.<h4>Results</h4>Our findings demonstrate that CRP expedites allograft rejection and diminishes allograft survival by selectively activating non-classical monocytes. Therapeutic stabilization of CRP abrogates this activating effect on monocytes, thereby attenuating acute allograft rejection. Intravital imagining of graft-infiltrating, recipient-derived monocytes during the early phase of acute rejection corroborated their differential regulation by CRP and their pivotal role in driving the initial stages of graft rejection.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The differential activation of recipient-derived monocytes by CRP exacerbates the innate immune response and accelerates clinical allograft rejection.

The early diagnosis and management are challenging due to the lack of reliable diagnostic markers and the occasional intractable cases despite conventional anti-inflammatory treatments. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have recently shown potential utility; however, reports on their use for pediatric patients with CNO remain limited, and no established biomarkers exist to monitor disease activity. We aimed to investigate the pathophysiology of CNO and explore the rapid testing methods for accurate diagnosis and also assessing the disease activity.<h4>Methods</h4>We assessed intracellular phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (pSTAT1) in peripheral blood monocytes or T cells following interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3) stimulation, using flow cytometry in 9 patients under 15\\xa0years old with CNO. The pSTAT1 expression levels were compared with those in patients with STAT1-gain of function (STAT1-GOF) mutations (n\\u2009=\\u20095), other autoinflammatory diseases (n\\u2009=\\u20097), and healthy controls.

Further, only large sCD18 complexes are capable of binding to ICAM-1. Migrating neutrophils shed large, but not small, sCD18 complexes. Together, these observations explain results measured from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), where large sCD18 complexes dominated in local inflammatory processes involving neutrophil influx into zones of inflammation. Our data points to a previously unappreciated aspect of sCD18 integrin biology as regulators of inflammation in the context of migrating leukocyte. Surprisingly, this regulation is tied to sCD18 complex size, opening new opportunities for therapeutic intervention in serious inflammatory diseases such as arthritis.', 'pubYear': '2025', 'doi': '10.1016/j.jtauto.2025.100266', 'authorString': 'Ferapontov A, Mellemkj\u00e6r A, McGettrick HM, Vorup-Jensen T, Kragstrup TW, Juul-Madsen K.'}, {'title': 'Biomarkers reflecting the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and guide therapeutic approach in systemic sclerosis: a narrative review.', 'abstract': 'Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a progressive autoimmune disorder that mainly affects the skin.

Immunohistochemistry showed that the expression of IS protein increased in injured tubular cells in the 5/6 nephrectomy group compared with that in the sham group. Furthermore, evaluations of serial kidney sections revealed that the expression site of IS protein was colocalized with the distal nephron, where the expression of MR protein was observed. MR-mediated transcriptional activity in COS-7 cells was increased in an aldosterone concentration-dependent manner. IS increased MR-mediated transcriptional activity and protein levels with and without aldosterone, and \u03b1-lipoic acid attenuated this increase.<h4>Conclusions</h4>IS could enhance MR transactivation by increasing MR protein levels through oxidative stress in CKD rats, indicating that treatment with MR antagonists and antioxidants may play a permissive role in inhibiting IS-induced CKD progression.', 'pubYear': '2024', 'doi': '10.7759/cureus.75236', 'authorString': 'Kudo A, Fukuda A, Gotoh K, Shibata H.'}, {'title': \"Immune Profile Differences between IgG4-Related Diseases and Primary Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome.\", 'abstract': \"<h4>Purpose</h4>Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) share clinical features with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (pSS).

Disease severity was assessed using the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28), and the relationship between DAS28 and PIV, SII, and SIRI, obtained from complete blood count results, was investigated. Additionally, C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate measurements were included in the study.<h4>Results</h4>The average age of RA patients was significantly higher than that of healthy individuals (<i>p</i> = 0.002). A positive correlation was found between the DAS28 score and the inflammation indices (SII, PIV, SIRI), with 65.98% of RA patients in the active phase and 34.02% in remission. Systemic immune-inflammation index had a predictive accuracy of 75.26%, PIV 71.13%, and SIRI 72.16%.

Emerging preclinical data suggests activated EGC have beneficial roles in controlling gut pathophysiology. <h4>Objective</h4> Understanding EGC activation and adaptation during experimental and clinical IBD. <h4>Design</h4> We provide the first highly integrated approach to identify EGC activation signature in IBD. Profiling 390 samples from IBD patients via bulk and single-nucleus (sn) transcriptomics and replicate the findings on publicly available bulk and single-cell (sc) datasets from 1160 patients and 19,000 single EGC. Preclinical modelling of Th1/Th17 inflammation, reporter-assisted EGC sorting, analysis of regulated cell death, and Casp8 ablation in EGC was performed <h4>Results</h4> We identified novel IBD type and sampling associated EGC activation signature. Specific EGC activation markers were shared in biopsies and resection specimens, and were divergent between Crohn\u2019s disease and Ulcerative colitis. Preclinical modelling of intestinal inflammation identified combinatorial TNF and IFN-\u03b3-driven activation of EGC, associated with elevated necroptosis, and negatively impacting gut motility. Genetic-reporter-enabled sorting and downstream analyses confirmed TNF and IFN-\u03b3-driven EGC necroptosis, potentiated by Casp8 deficiency. Furthermore, snRNA-Seq from IBD patient samples confirmed elevated cell death signature in activated but not in rare neuroglia progenitor-like cluster. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Our findings identify IBD type-associated activated EGC markers involved in immune and epithelial homeoastasis. We uncover necroptosis of activated EGCs as a constituent of intestinal inflammation. Advancing our understanding of activated EGC survival is pivotal in elucidating their complex roles in maintaining gut immune-epithelial homeostasis. <h4>What is already known on this topic</h4> Activated EGC have emerged as important contributors in maintaining epithelial, immune and neuronal homeostasis. Increasing evidence from mouse studies points to the role of activated EGC in epithelial regeneration, tolerogenic T-cell activation, relaying psychological stress to the enteric nervous system, post-injury neurogenesis, and helminth clearance. Nevertheless, no consensus has emerged on what might define activated EGC in the context of IBD and how EGC turnover is affected in gut inflammation, limiting translation of their disease associated roles. <h4>What this study adds</h4> By combining bulk with single cell and single nucleus transcriptomes from IBD patients we identified new IBD type\u2013 and location-associated EGC activation signatures. Some of these are conserved with mouse EGC in gut inflammation models. We identified osteopontin an immunomodulator and Wnt6 an epithelial morphogen elevated in IBD EGC. We also identified IBD-associated EGC cell clusters, which display higher expression of cell death pathway transcripts. To investigate EGC turnover, we utilized preclinical models and found rapid EGC activation upon Th1/Th17 inflammation. This was associated with elevated EGC activation and caspase-independent necroptotic cell death. Ex vivo experiments showed a combinatorial requirement of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF in mediating EGC necroptosis. Our findings were replicated on multiple publicly available sc-RNA sequencing datasets from IBD patients. <h4>How this study might affect research, practice or policy</h4> Expanding on the available repertoire of EGC activation markers in IBD, both shared and unique to sampling procedure, disease type, and location will provide researchers with tools to identify EGC homeostasis during IBD. Moreover, the nature of the identified markers will stimulate research into specific EGC pathways triggered in inflammation. Adding to this, the rapid induction in pathological death of activated but not naive EGC upon IFN-\u03b3 and TNF stimulation will shed light on EGC adaptation and turnover. Our identification of markers of activated EGC with immuno-modulatory and epithelial-regenerative properties, including osteopontin and wingless family of morphogenes will stimulate further research in EGC-immune and EGC-epithelial communication in the context of IBD.', 'pubYear': '2025', 'doi': '10.1101/2025.04.03.646820', 'authorString': 'Bubeck M, Penkert KA, Limberger H, Acera MG, Plattner C, Ziegler S, Muppirala A, Forster P, Jakob M, Gamez-Belmonte R, Erkert L, Kulkarni S, G\u00fcnther C, Atreya R, K\u00fchl AA, Hegazy AN, Hildner K, Trajanoski Z, Siegmund B, Neurath MF, IBDome Consortium, Rao M, Progatzky F, Lie DC, Becker C, Romagnani C, Ludwig LS, Klose CSN, Patankar JV.'}, {'title': 'Wnt signaling as a translational target in rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis.', 'abstract': '<h4>Background</h4>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are chronic inflammatory diseases mainly affecting joints. RA primarily targets the synovial joints and is characterized by cartilage and bone erosion, whereas PsA is associated with skin and nail psoriasis and is characterized by erosive bone damage with an exuberant bone formation and soft tissue involvement. Recent evidence described the involvement of the Wnt pathway in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Thus, we aimed to analyze some components of Wnt signaling, i.e. DKK1, Wnt 5a and \u03b2-catenin, and their association with disease activity indices, investigating possible differences between the two diseases.<h4>Methods</h4>Sera from 18 RA patients na\u00efve for biological therapy, 18 PsA patients and 20 matched healthy donors (HD) were tested for DKK1 by ELISA, Wnt 5a and \u03b2-catenin by Immunoblotting. Values were correlated with CTX-1, detected by ELISA, and with disease activity indices: Disease Activity Score on 28 joints (DAS28-CRP) for RA and the Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) score for PsA.<h4>Results</h4>This study highlights significant increase in DKK1, Wnt 5a, and \u03b2-catenin levels in RA and PsA patients compared to HD, with distinct patterns of correlation with disease activity indices. Indeed, in RA patients, DKK1 levels positively correlated with DAS28-CRP score, whereas in PsA patients, DKK1 levels negatively correlated with DAPSA score. Our findings showed a strong correlation between DKK1 and CTX-1 levels in RA patients, supporting the relationship between DKK1 levels and the presence of joint erosions. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was found between \u03b2-catenin and IL-6 levels in RA, indicating that \u03b2-catenin may be involved in the inflammatory cascade.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study compares the involvement of Wnt signaling in RA and PsA, suggesting that Wnt signaling may represent a possible mechanism of disease activity. In particular, it indicates that DKK1 levels are correlated with CTX-1, a marker of bone resorption, and with disease activity in RA patients.

Logistic regression was used to evaluate gout prevalence among individuals with different pulmonary function statuses. Propensity score matching\\xa0(PSM) created balanced groups, while Cox regression gauged the risk association between reduced lung capacity and gout compared with normal function. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was used to verify causal associations. Non-linear correlations were assessed with restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis, and mediation analysis was used to explore the role of blood biomarkers. Mediation analyses were used to investigate the potential mediating role of biomarkers in the association.<h4>Results</h4>Cross-sectional analysis revealed a higher prevalence of gout in individuals with preserved ratio of impaired spirometry (PRISm) of 6.31% and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) of 6.26% than in those with normal pulmonary function (3.45%).

Longitudinal analysis confirmed that impaired pulmonary function significantly increased the risk of developing gout (hazard ratio [HR] 1.32, 95% CI 1.24-1.40). MR further revealed a potential causal effect of decreased pulmonary function on an increased risk of gout. Subgroup analysis revealed significant interactions between impaired pulmonary function and several factors, including body mass index (BMI), levels of physical activity, and diabetes status, in their associations with the risk of gout. RCS analysis showed a nonlinear relationship between pulmonary function indicators and gout incidence, characterized by an inverse S-shaped curve. Mediation analysis revealed that urate levels (49.1% mediation proportion), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (6.62%), monocyte counts (1.33%), and neutrophil counts (4.85%) significantly mediated the relationship between pulmonary function and the risk of gout.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study revealed a significant association between impaired pulmonary function and an increased risk of developing gout.

The activation of the pyrin inflammasome is the mainstay of the pathogenesis, which might lead to a specific cell-death mechanism, pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a programmed inflammatory cell death mediated by gasdermin proteins, featuring cell swelling, membrane rupture, and release of inflammatory contents Aim: In this study we aimed to analyze the cell-death mechanisms in the pathogenesis of FMF attacks.<h4>Methods</h4>Twenty-five FMF patients were included, and PFAPA patients (<i>n</i> = 10) and healthy controls (HC, <i>n</i> = 10) served as controls. We collected plasma samples from FMF and PFAPA patients during the attack and the attack-free period. We measured the soluble plasma levels of sFas, sFasL, granzyme A, granzyme B, perforin, granulysin, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-6, IL-17A, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 by commercial pre-defined cytometric bead array kits.<h4>Results</h4>There was no significant difference between groups in terms of sex and age between FMF patients and HCs, but PFAPA patients were younger than other groups due to the nature of the disease. We then analyzed the components of apoptosis and pyroptosis. The levels of sFasL (<i>p</i> = 0.035) and granzyme A (<i>p</i> = 0.038) in FMF patients were significantly increased during the attack period and decreased to levels comparable to HCs during the attack-free period. This increase was not seen in the PFAPA patients, with comparable levels with the HC group both during attack period and attack-free period. During the attack period of FMF patients, granzyme B (<i>p</i> = 0.145) and perforin (<i>p</i> = 0.203) levels were also increased; however, the differences were not statistically significant. The levels of sFasL, granzyme A, granzyme B, and perforin were closely correlated with each other during the attack period of FMF patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study on death pathways during an FMF attack, suggests an upregulation in both pyroptosis through the granzyme-gasdermin pathway and apoptosis with the increased FasL and perforin levels, which was different from PFAPA patients.

Echocardiography confirmed moderate concentric hypertrophy with Grade II diastolic dysfunction and a preserved ejection fraction. To rule out secondary causes of hypertension, an arterial Doppler was done, which showed features of renal artery stenosis and stenosis in the descending aorta.

RNA-sequencing was performed to evaluate the regulatory mechanisms of MTHFD2 on osteoclastogenesis. Extracellular flux assay, JC-1 staining, and transmission electron microscopy were used to detect mitochondrial function and energy metabolism changes during osteoclast formation. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of MTHFD2 knockdown on bone loss. Bone volume and osteoclast counts were quantified by \u03bcCT and histomorphometry.<h4>Results</h4>Elevated MTHFD2 was observed in RA patients and CIA mice with a positive correlation to bone resorption parameters. During osteoclast formation, MTHFD2 was significantly upregulated in both human CD14\\u2009+\\u2009monocytes and murine BMMs. The application of MTHFD2 inhibitor and MTHFD2 knockdown suppressed osteoclastogenesis, while MTHFD2 overexpression promoted osteoclast differentiation in vitro. RNA-sequencing revealed that MTHFD2 inhibition blocked oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in osteoclasts, leading to decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and mitochondrial membrane potential without affecting mitochondrial biogenesis. Mechanistically, inhibition of MTHFD2 downregulated the expression of mitochondrial creatine kinase 1 (CKMT1), which in turn affected phosphocreatine energy shuttle and OXPHOS during osteoclastogenesis. Further, a therapeutic strategy to knock down MTHFD2 in knee joint in vivo ameliorated bone loss in CIA mice.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings demonstrate that MTHFD2 is upregulated in RA with relation to joint destruction.

This study explores ferroptosis in TAK using high-throughput and single-cell transcriptomics.<h4>Methods</h4>Transcriptomic data were collected from 8 TAK patients (2 for single cell RNA-seq and 6 for bulk RNA-seq) and 8 renal transplant donors, with single-cell data from 3 public carotid artery samples for control. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to identify ferroptosis-related genes in inflamed arteries.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 1526 differentially expressed genes and 46 ferroptosis-related genes, with 6 genes including PTGS2 and HIF1A as hub genes. Single-cell analysis of 27,828 cells revealed increased M1-like macrophages, with PTGS2\\xa0highly expressed in these cells. Enrichment analysis indicated NF-\u03baB signal pathway involvement.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PTGS2 is a core ferroptosis-related gene in TAK vascular inflammation, highly expressed in M1-like macrophages, potentially upregulated via the IL1B-NF-\u03baB pathway.', 'pubYear': '2024', 'doi': '10.2147/jir.s478413', 'authorString': 'Gao Q, Gao S, Li H, Chen Z, Zhang R, Li Y, Zhang H.'}, {'title': 'FoxO1 Deficiency in Monocytic Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells Exacerbates B Cell Dysfunction in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.', 'abstract': \"<h4>Objective</h4>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), in part due to promoting the survival of plasma cells. FoxO1 expression in monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) exhibits a negative correlation with the SLE Disease Activity Index score. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that M-MDSC-specific FoxO1 deficiency enhances aberrant B cell function in aggressive SLE.<h4>Methods</h4>We used GEO data sets and clinical cohorts to verify the clinical significance of FoxO1 expression and circulating M-MDSCs. Using Cre-LoxP technology, we generated myeloid FoxO1 deficiency mice (mFoxO1<sup>-/-</sup>) to establish murine lupus-prone models. The transcriptional stage was assessed by integrating chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing with transcriptomic analysis, luciferase reporter assay, and ChIP-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing, RNA sequencing, and CRISPR-dCas9 were used to identify N<sup>6</sup>-adenosine methylation (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification. In vitro B cell coculture experiments, capmatinib intragastric administration, m<sup>6</sup>A-modulated MDSCs adoptive transfer, and sample validation of patients with SLE were performed to determine the role of FoxO1 on M-MDSCs dysregulation during B cell autoreacted with SLE.<h4>Results</h4>We present evidence that low FoxO1 is predominantly expressed in M-MDSCs in both patients with SLE and lupus mice, and mice with myeloid FoxO1 deficiency (mFoxO1<sup>-/-</sup>) are more prone to B cell dysfunction. Mechanically, FoxO1 inhibits mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor protein (Met) transcription by binding to the promoter region. M-MDSCs FoxO1 deficiency blocks the Met/cyclooxygenase2/prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> secretion pathway, promoting B cell proliferation and hyperactivation. The Met antagonist capmatinib effectively mitigates lupus exacerbation. Furthermore, alkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) targeting catalyzes m<sup>6</sup>A modification on FoxO1 messenger RNA in coding sequences and 3' untranslated regions. The up-regulation of FoxO1 mediated by ALKBH5 overexpression in M-MDSCs improves lupus progression. Finally, these correlations were confirmed in untreated patients with SLE.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings indicate that effective inhibition of B cells mediated by the ALKBH5/FoxO1/Met axis in M-MDSCs could offer a novel therapeutic approach to manage SLE.\", 'pubYear': '2025', 'doi': '10.1002/art.43046', 'authorString': 'Tan L, Kong W, Zhou K, Wang S, Liang J, Hou Y, Dou H.'}, {'title': 'Macrophage involvement in idiopathic inflammatory myopathy: pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic prospects.', 'abstract': 'Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are a group of systemic autoimmune diseases characterized by chronic muscle inflammation and diverse clinical manifestations.

Although platelets have been suggested as one of these contributors through the release of their content during activation, there are limited specific data about their role as immune players in SLE.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Thirteen SLE patients were included. Flow cytometry was used to measure Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2, 4, and 9 in resting platelets, platelet-activation markers (PAC-1 binding, P-selectin, CD63, and CD40 ligand -L) and platelet-leukocyte aggregates before and after specific TLR stimulation. Soluble CD40L and von Willebrand factor (vWf) release from stimulated platelets was measured using ELISA.<h4>Results</h4>In resting conditions, SLE platelets showed normal expression levels of TLR 2, 4 and 9. Platelet surface activation markers, soluble CD40L, and vWf release were normal at baseline and after TLR stimulation. Platelet-monocyte aggregates were elevated in resting conditions in SLE samples and showed only a marginal increase after TLR stimulation, while baseline and stimulated platelet-neutrophil and platelet-lymphocyte aggregates were normal. C-reactive protein levels positively correlated with platelet-monocyte aggregates both at baseline and after stimulation with the TLR-2 agonist PAM3CSK4, suggesting these complexes could reflect the inflammatory activity in SLE. In our cohort, 12 of 13 patients received treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a known inhibitor of endosomal activity and a potential inhibitor of platelet activation. The fact that SLE platelets showed an adequate response to TLR agonists suggests that, despite this treatment, they retain the ability to respond to the increased levels of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which represent known TLR ligands, present in the circulation of SLE patients. Interestingly, elevated plasma levels of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a classical DAMP, correlated with vWf release from TLR-stimulated platelets, suggesting that HMGB1 may also be released by platelets, thereby creating a positive feedback loop for platelet activation that contributes to inflammation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study demonstrates normal platelet TLR expression and function together with increased circulating platelet-monocyte aggregates. In addition, a direct correlation was observed between plasma HMGB1 levels and platelet vWf release following TLR2 stimulation.

Mechanistically, estrogen regulates osteoblast and osteoclast activity, thereby affecting bone turnover and maintenance of alveolar bone density. Studies indicate that estrogen upregulates the periodontal ligament stem cells' osteogenic differentiation (PDLSCs), promoting collagen synthesis and matrix mineralization critical for periodontal tissue integrity. Moreover, estrogen's anti-inflammatory properties modulate cytokine expression and immune responses in the periodontium, potentially attenuating periodontal inflammation and tissue destruction. Conversely, estrogen deficiency, such as in postmenopausal women, correlates with increased susceptibility to periodontal diseases characterized by greater clinical attachment loss and alveolar bone resorption. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen has shown promise in clinical settings, demonstrating beneficial effects on periodontal health by reducing inflammation and maintaining alveolar bone density.

Furthermore, the dynamic interplay and imbalance among ECs, PCs, and glial cells within the neurovascular unit (NVU) are pivotal drivers of BRB destruction, exacerbating RGC apoptosis and limiting optic nerve regeneration. The intricate molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these processes underscore the BRB's critical role in glaucoma and TON pathophysiology while offering a compelling foundation for therapeutic strategies targeting BRB repair and stabilization.

This review aims to highlight the regulatory functions of eosinophils within the bone niche and emphasize the importance of further research into their role in bone biology.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Growing evidence suggests that eosinophils are key regulators of bone metabolism, extending beyond their established roles in immunity and inflammation. They contribute to bone homeostasis by inhibiting osteoclast differentiation, helping to prevent excessive bone resorption in osteoporosis and inflammatory arthritis. Additionally, eosinophils may promote osteoblast-mediated bone formation, modulate the mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cell niche, and contribute to the bone microenvironment by affecting vascularization and extracellular matrix composition. However, their impact may vary under pathological conditions. Patients with eosinophilic disorders are often at an increased risk of osteoporosis and fragility fractures, though this is largely attributed to disease-related treatments rather than eosinophil activity itself.

Elafibranor (EFN), a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1/\u03b4 agonist, has shown promise as a therapeutic candidate in preclinical studies. EFN reduces liver fibrosis by inhibiting lipid accumulation, apoptosis, and inflammatory pathways (LPS/TLR4/NF-\u03baB), while enhancing autophagy and antioxidant responses. It also improves intestinal barrier function and modulates gut microbiota, reducing endotoxin-producing bacteria and increasing beneficial species. By strengthening the intestinal barrier and suppressing pro-inflammatory mediators like tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6, EFN mitigates hepatic stellate cell activation and fibrogenic signaling. Macrophages play a central role in ALD progression, and EFN's ability to modulate macrophage activity further highlights its anti-inflammatory properties. This review emphasizes EFN's dual-targeted approach, addressing both hepatic and intestinal dysfunctions, distinguishing it from conventional ALD treatments. While preclinical results are promising, EFN remains under clinical investigation, with ongoing trials evaluating its safety and efficacy. Future research should focus on elucidating EFN's molecular mechanisms and advancing its clinical application to establish its therapeutic potential in human populations.

As a member of the gelatinase subgroup of matrix metalloproteinases, MMP-2 is involved in a variety of physiological processes, including tissue repair, wound healing, angiogenesis, and embryogenesis. It is primarily responsible for the degradation of type IV and V collagen, fibronectin, laminin, and elastin, which are essential components of the ECM. MMP-2 is secreted as an inactive pro-enzyme (proMMP-2) and activated through proteolytic cleavage, with its activity being precisely regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Dysregulation of MMP-2 has been linked to a variety of pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetic complications, kidney diseases, and cancer. In cardiovascular diseases, it contributes to vascular remodeling, atherosclerosis, and aneurysms, while in fibrotic diseases, it mediates excessive ECM degradation leading to tissue scarring. In diabetes, elevated MMP-2 activity exacerbates complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease. In cancer, MMP-2 facilitates tumor invasion and metastasis by degrading ECM components and promoting angiogenesis. Despite its essential roles in both physiological and pathological processes, targeting MMP-2 for therapeutic purposes presents challenges due to its dual functions in tissue remodeling and repair, raising concerns about unplanned consequences such as impaired tissue healing or excessive tissue damage. These challenges underscore the need for future research to focus on developing selective modulators that can precisely balance their activity under specific disease environments. Clinical trials targeting MMP-2 modulation highlight the potential of gelatinase inhibitors, including those targeting MMP-2, to reduce tumor progression in fibrosarcoma, breast, and lung cancers.

In addition, obesity is closely linked to chronic kidney disease (CKD) by either exacerbating diabetic complications or directly causing kidney damage. Obesity-related CKD is characterized by proteinuria, lipid accumulation, fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis, which can gradually impair kidney function. Among the immune cells of the innate and adaptive immune response involved in the pathogenesis of obesity-related diseases, macrophages play a crucial role in the inflammation associated with CKD. In obese individuals, macrophages enter a pro-inflammatory state known as M1 polarization, which contributes to chronic inflammation. This polarization promotes tissue damage, inflammation and fibrosis, leading to progressive loss of kidney function. In addition, macrophage-induced oxidative stress is a key feature of CKD as it also promotes cell damage and inflammation. Macrophages also contribute to insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes by releasing inflammatory molecules that impair glucose metabolism, complicating the management of diabetes in obese patients. Hypertension and atherosclerosis, which are often associated with obesity, also contribute to the progression of CKD via immune and inflammatory pathways. Macrophages influence blood pressure regulation and contribute to vascular inflammation, particularly via the renin-angiotensin system.

The differential expression of MMPs may be one of the reasons for the varying degrees of intervertebral disc destruction in different types of spinal infections.

This regenerative process encompasses several key stages, including distal axon degeneration, myelin breakdown, clearance of myelin debris, inflammatory responses from non-neuronal cells, and subsequent axonal regeneration. The immune response, recognized for its role in clearing myelin debris and modulating the local inflammatory milieu, is crucial for initiating axonal regeneration at the proximal stump of nerves.

Nanofat, a minimally processed human fat graft rich in stromal vascular fraction (SVF) secretory factors, has shown promise in relieving pain. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying nanofat treatment of OA-affected cells and compare two filtration systems used for nanofat preparation.<h4>Methods</h4>Chondrocytes and synoviocytes were isolated from articular cartilage and synovium of 22 OA-patients. Lipoaspirates from 13 OA-patients were emulsified using the Adinizer<sup>\u00ae</sup> or Lipocube<sup>\u2122</sup> Nano filter systems to generate nanofat. The fluid phase of SVF from both filtered and unfiltered lipoaspirates was applied to OA-affected cells. Luminex multiplex ELISA were performed with lipoaspirates and cell supernatants alongside functional assays evaluating cell migration, proliferation, metabolic activity, and senescence.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 62 cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, neuropeptides, matrix-degrading enzymes, and complement components were identified in lipoaspirates. Among these, significant concentration differences were observed for TIMP-2, TGF-\u00df<sub>3</sub>, and complement component C3 between the filtered and unfiltered samples. Nanofat enhanced chondrocyte proliferation and migration, as well as synoviocyte migration and metabolic activity, while reducing chondrocyte metabolic activity. Pain-related factors like \u03b2-NGF, MCP-1, Substance P, VEGF, and \u03b1CGRP were reduced, while anti-inflammatory TGF-\u03b2<sub>1+3</sub> increased and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-5, IL-7, IL-15, and IFN-\u03b3) decreased. Nanofat also elevated secretion of complement components and TIMPs in both cell types. Notably, our results revealed no significant differences in cellular effects between sSVF filtered using the Adinizer<sup>\u00ae</sup> and Lipocube<sup>\u2122</sup> Nano systems, as well as compared to unfiltered sSVF.<h4>Discussion</h4>Here, we provide first insights into how autologous nanofat therapy may ameliorate OA by enhancing chondrocyte proliferation and synoviocyte migration while modulating inflammatory and pain-related factors.

Pararamosis is an inflammatory disease resulting from accidental contact with the caterpillar's bristles, leading to acute and chronic symptoms. Chronic exposure can cause significant osteoarticular deformities, similar to those seen in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, due to cartilage degradation and synovial inflammation. Currently, there are no specific treatments for Pararamosis, and research on the molecular mechanisms of the caterpillar's venom and its role in disease pathogenesis is limited. The chronic changes in Pararamosis are thought to be linked to chondrocyte activation and the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, influenced by the toxic components in the bristles. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing preventive measures and therapeutic strategies, especially for rubber tappers at risk in the Amazon region.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>This study investigated the effects of P. semirufa bristle extracts on human chondrocytes, focusing on the activation mechanism of the NF-\u03baB transcription factor and the expression of osteoarthritis markers. Cell viability tests indicated that the extracts did not significantly affect chondrocyte survival. However, supernatant analysis revealed a time- and dose-dependent increase in IL-6 and IL-8 levels. Additionally, the expression of NF-\u03baB and its inhibitor, I\u03baB, was assessed, showing higher levels of phosphorylated I\u03baB, which induces its proteosomal degradation, compared to the negative control, while native I\u03baB expression was greater in the control group. Furthermore, the gene expression profile of treated chondrocytes demonstrated modulation in matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), aggrecan (ACAN), collagen type II (COL2A1), interleukins (IL6 and IL8), and complement system molecules.<h4>Conclusions/significance</h4>These findings highlight the significant impact of P. semirufa bristle extracts on human chondrocyte activation and the inflammatory processes associated with pararamosis.\", 'pubYear': '2025', 'doi': '10.1371/journal.pntd.0012816', 'authorString': 'de Lima CL, Pohl PC, Villas-Boas IM, Pidde G, Tambourgi DV.'}, {'title': 'Targeting tumor-associated macrophages in colon cancer: mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.', 'abstract': 'Colon cancer (CC) remains a primary contributor to cancer-related fatalities worldwide, driven by difficulties in early diagnosis and constrained therapeutic options.

In the process of cancer cell migration, chemokines secreted by target tissues, as well as the profile of chemokine receptors presented on cancer cells, play a key role. In the presented work, five components of the TME were selected: MMP-2, MMP-7, TIMP-2, CXCL-9, and CXCL-10.

The research models the diffusion of M2 macrophages in inflamed tissue using a novel dynamical system with partial differential equation (PDE) constraints.

Succinate promotes inflammation whilst itaconate is anti-inflammatory, suppressing inflammatory joint disease in models. Itaconate deficiency also correlates inversely with disease severity in RA in humans.

However, the effects of RV-D1 on synovitis remain unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of RV-D1 in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (HFLSs) and the underlying mechanisms. The expression of the HFLS formyl peptide receptor 2 (ALX/FPR) was examined via immunocytochemical analysis. HFLSs were treated with 1\\xa0ng/mL recombinant human interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and RV-D1. The gene expression of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL1B), matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3), and MMP13 was examined using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction after treatment with IL-1\u03b2 and RV-D1. The effect of RV-D1 on apoptosis was examined based on fluorescence intensity. Phosphorylation of p-38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), and AKT was analyzed via western blotting. ALX/FPR staining was observed on the cell surface. RV-D1 significantly suppressed the IL-1\u03b2-induced increase in gene and protein expression of IL-1\u03b2, MMP-3, and MMP-13. Pretreatment with 100\\xa0nM RV-D1 significantly increased the fluorescence intensity compared to that in the non-treatment group. Furthermore, pretreatment with RV-D1 significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of p-38, NF-\u03baB, and AKT. Whereas WRW4, an antagonist of ALX/ FPR2, treatment weakened the effect of RV-D1, resulting in p-38, NF-\u03baB, and AKT phosphorylation and the protein expression of MMP-13 at levels comparable to those in the IL-1\u03b2 without RV-D1.

SMYD5, a member of the histone lysine methyltransferase subfamily SMYDs, is involved in many pathological processes. This study aimed to investigate the role of SMYD5 in regulating synovial fibroblast homeostasis and the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).<h4>Methods</h4>Proteomic screening was conducted to assess SMYD5 expression in the synovium of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and RA. In vitro, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) was used to induce proliferation and inflammation in FLS. Further, we performed loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments to investigate the biological function of SMYD5. In vivo, adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors carrying SMYD5 short-hairpin RNA (AAV-shSMYD5) were injected into the knee joints to knock down SMYD5 in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model to evaluate its role in joint damage.<h4>Results</h4>We observed a significant elevation of SMYD5 expression in the synovial tissues of patients with RA and IL-1\u03b2-induced FLS. SMYD5 facilitated posttranslational modifications and activated downstream signaling pathways, thereby promoting proliferation and inflammation in FLS. Mechanistically, SMYD5 mediated the methylation of Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1), which accelerated its degradation through ubiquitination, resulting in substantial FLS proliferation. Additionally, SMYD5 promoted lactate release to activate NF-\u03baB signaling pathways by upregulating hexokinases-2 (HK2) expression, a key glycolytic enzyme, thereby intensifying the inflammatory response in FLS. Supporting these findings, intraarticular delivery of AAV-mediated SMYD5 knockdown in the CIA mice model effectively alleviated joint swelling, bone erosion, and overall arthritis severity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Together, these findings suggest that SMYD5 is a dual target for regulating synovial fibroblast homeostasis and the pathogenesis of RA.

Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) play a central role in RA, producing a significant amount of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-\u03b1 and IL-6, which promote inflammatory responses within the joints. Moreover, FLS exhibit tumor-like behavior, including aggressive proliferation and enhanced anti-apoptotic capabilities, which collectively drive chronic inflammation and joint damage in RA. TNF is a major pro-inflammatory cytokine that mediates a series of signaling pathways through its receptor TNFR1, including NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways, which are crucial for inflammation and cell survival in RA. The abnormal proliferation and anti-apoptotic characteristics of FLS in RA may result from dysregulation in TNF-mediated cell death pathways such as apoptosis and necroptosis.

Experiments in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice, the classical animal model of RA, show that IGF2BP1 R176K point mutation (Igf2bp1<sup>R167K/R167K</sup>) mice exert reduced inflammatory response, clinical scores, and joint destruction. At a molecular level, citrullination of IGF2BP1 promotes the stability of SEMA3D mRNA by promoting the interaction between IGF2BP1 and its cofactor ELAV-like protein 1 (ELAVL1), thereby promoting the invasiveness of RA-FLSs. In this study, a new citrullinated protein of IGF2BP1 is discovered, and the molecular mechanism of its citrullinated modification promoting the progression of RA disease is elucidated, which provides theoretical basis for the diagnosis and treatment of RA.', 'pubYear': '2025', 'doi': '10.1038/s42003-025-07492-3', 'authorString': 'Qin Y, Liu L, Zhang Y, Chen X, Zhang J, Ling S, Wang J, Yang X.'}, {'title': 'CCN2 mediates fibroblast-macrophage interaction in knee arthrofibrosis based on single-cell RNA-seq analysis.', 'abstract': 'Knee arthrofibrosis, characterized by excessive matrix protein production and deposition, substantially impairs basic daily functions, causing considerable distress and financial burden.

In this article, we review the research progress on the source of cytoplasmic DNA, the mechanism of assembly and activation of AIM2 inflammasome, and the related roles of other cytoplasmic DNA sensors in rheumatoid arthritis.', 'pubYear': '2024', 'doi': '10.3389/fimmu.2024.1343325', 'authorString': 'Xu C, Jing W, Liu C, Yuan B, Zhang X, Liu L, Zhang F, Chen P, Liu Q, Wang H, Du X.'}, {'title': 'Polymethoxyflavones and Bone Metabolism.', 'abstract': 'Phytochemicals, such as flavonoids, are bioactive compounds produced by plants, including citrus fruits, that exhibit antioxidant effects on mammalian cells and tissues. Polymethoxyflavones (PMFs) are a family of flavonoids found in the pulp and peel of citrus fruits, and have been reported to have potent antioxidant activity implicated in the prevention of human diseases. Several studies have shown that PMFs have a protective effect on bone resorption in mouse models of diseases, including osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and periodontal disease. PMFs significantly suppressed the differentiation of osteoclasts (bone resorptive cells) through indirect and direct mechanisms. The indirect effect of PMFs is the suppression of inflammatory mediator production, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and the reduction of osteoclastic inducers, such as the receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL), in osteoblasts (bone-forming cells). The direct effect of PMF suppresses osteoclast differentiation and function by inhibiting the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. In silico molecular docking studies indicated that PMFs target the ATP-binding pocket of IKK\u03b2 and inhibit the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.

RA, affecting 0.5% to 1.0% of the global population, leads to chronic joint damage and comorbidities. OA, primarily afflicting the elderly, results in joint degradation and severe pain. Both conditions incur substantial healthcare expenses and productivity losses. The cGAS-STING pathway, consisting of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING), is a crucial component of mammalian immunity. This pathway is responsible for detecting foreign DNA, particularly double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), triggering innate immune defense responses. When cGAS recognizes dsDNA, it catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which then binds to and activates STING. Activated STING, in turn, initiates downstream signaling events leading to the production of interferons and other immune mediators. The cGAS-STING pathway is essential for defending against viral infections and maintaining cellular balance. Dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in various inflammatory diseases, including arthritis, making it a target for potential therapeutic interventions. Understanding the intricate molecular signaling network of cGAS-STING in these arthritis forms offers potential avenues for targeted therapies. Addressing these challenges through improved early detection, comprehensive management, and interventions targeting the cGAS-STING pathway is crucial for alleviating the impact of OA and RA on individuals and healthcare systems.

Bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9), a member of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily, plays a key role in osteogenesis and tissue repair. However, its role in bone erosion and inflammation in RA remains underexplored. This study aims to evaluate BMP9's therapeutic potential in RA, focusing on its effects on bone destruction, osteogenesis, and inflammation.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In this study, BMP9 expression was analyzed in synovial tissues from RA and osteoarthritis patients and in the ankle joints of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice using immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting. The therapeutic effect of BMP9 on bone destruction was evaluated in a CIA mouse model through micro-CT imaging, histological analysis, and clinical scoring. Osteogenic differentiation was assessed by alkaline phosphatase and Alizarin Red S staining, while osteoclast activity was examined through tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining. Fluorescence double-labeling was used to track new bone formation. Data were analyzed using (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) SPSS, and appropriate statistical tests were performed to determine significance.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, BMP9 expression was significantly down-regulated in the synovial tissue of RA patients and in the ankle joints of CIA mice. BMP9 treatment in CIA mice ameliorated joint inflammation, as shown by reduced limb swelling, lower arthritis index, and improved tissue morphology. Furthermore, BMP9 significantly alleviated bone loss, as evidenced by increased bone mineral density and trabecular structure. However, BMP9 treatment did not significantly impact osteoclastogenesis or bone resorption. BMP9 also enhanced bone mineralization and formation, as shown by increased mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate. Additionally, BMP9 promoted osteogenic differentiation of synovial cells, enhancing alkaline phosphatase activity and mineral nodule formation. These results suggest that BMP9 has a protective effect on joint inflammation and bone loss in RA, potentially through promoting bone formation without influencing osteoclast activity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study concludes that targeting BMP9 alleviates inflammation and promotes osteogenic differentiation in RA, highlighting BMP9 as a promising therapeutic target for addressing bone destruction in RA.\", 'pubYear': '2025', 'doi': '10.1186/s12967-025-06309-5', 'authorString': 'Zhang H, Dang Z, Wang X, Wang C, Zhang H, Zhang Y.'}, {'title': 'Metabolic changes in fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis: state of the art review.', 'abstract': 'Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) are important components of the synovial membrane.

Recent metabolomic studies have demonstrated that metabolic changes, including those in glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism, exist before synovitis onset.

They do this by modulating protein-protein interactions or through base pairing with RNA and DNA. Here we review the current understanding of the mechanism of action of lncRNAs as novel immune-related regulators and their impact on physiological and pathological processes related to the immune system, including autoimmune diseases. We also highlight the emerging pattern of gene expression control in important research areas at the intersection between immunology and lncRNA biology.', 'pubYear': '2025', 'doi': '10.1016/j.ncrna.2024.09.001', 'authorString': 'Ghahramani Almanghadim H, Karimi B, Valizadeh S, Ghaedi K.'}, {'title': 'Wound healing: insights into autoimmunity, ageing, and cancer ecosystems through inflammation and IL-6 modulation.', 'abstract': 'Wound healing represents a complex and evolutionarily conserved process across vertebrates, encompassing a series of life-rescuing events. The healing process runs in three main phases: inflammation, proliferation, and maturation/remodelling. While acute inflammation is indispensable for cleansing the wound, removing infection, and eliminating dead tissue characterised by the prevalence of neutrophils, the proliferation phase is characterised by transition into the inflammatory cell profile, shifting towards the prevalence of macrophages. The proliferation phase involves development of granulation tissue, comprising fibroblasts, activated myofibroblasts, and inflammatory and endothelial cells. Communication among these cellular components occurs through intercellular contacts, extracellular matrix secretion, as well as paracrine production of bioactive factors and proteolytic enzymes. The proliferation phase of healing is intricately regulated by inflammation, particularly interleukin-6. Prolonged inflammation results in dysregulations during the granulation tissue formation and may lead to the development of chronic wounds or hypertrophic/keloid scars. Notably, pathological processes such as autoimmune chronic inflammation, organ fibrosis, the tumour microenvironment, and impaired repair following viral infections notably share morphological and functional similarities with granulation tissue. Consequently, wound healing emerges as a prototype for understanding these diverse pathological processes. The prospect of gaining a comprehensive understanding of wound healing holds the potential to furnish fundamental insights into modulation of the intricate dialogue between cancer cells and non-cancer cells within the cancer ecosystem.

The pathogenesis underlying joint disease in DJDs remains unclear. Considering the severe toxicities reported with anti-inflammatory and disease-modifying agents, there is a clear need to develop new treatments that are specific in their effect while not being associated with significant toxicities. A key feature in the development of joint disease is the overexpression of adhesion molecules, e.g., CD44. Expression of CD44 and its variants in the synovial tissues of patients with DJDs is strongly associated with cartilage damage and appears to be a predicting factor of synovial inflammation in DJDs. Targeting CD44 and its downstream signaling proteins has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. PRG4 is a mucinous glycoprotein that binds to the CD44 receptor and is physiologically involved in joint lubrication. PRG4-CD44 is a pivotal regulator of synovial lining cell hemostasis in the joint, where lack of PRG4 expression triggers chronic inflammation and fibrosis, driven by persistent activation of synovial cells.

The proliferation, migration and invasion of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) stimulated with or without tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 were examined by CCK-8, wound healing and transwell assays, respectively. IF and WB were applied to investigate related mechanism in FLSs. The molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, CETSA and siRNA were used to analyze the interaction of MOIG with target. Finally, the adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) mice model with gene knockdown was used to confirm the effect of MOIG on glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2).<h4>Results</h4>MOIG significantly alleviated the paw swelling and synovial hyperplasia in CIA rats. Moreover, MOIG suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion, the secretion of inflammatory factors, and the expression of adhesion related proteins in TNF-\u03b1-stimulated FLSs. MOIG also inhibited the activation of Janus activating kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway in FLSs. Interestingly, the plant metabolites in MOIG had a good affinity with GSK-3\u03b2, and inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2 attenuated the effects of MOIG on FLSs.

Then, transcriptomic data and proteomic data of Celastrol treatment of RA were collected. Subsequently, Celastrol-RA targets, differentially expressed genes, and differentially expressed proteins were imported into Metascape for enrichment analysis, and related networks were constructed. Finally, the core targets of Celastrol-RA targets, differentially expressed genes, and differentially expressed proteins were mapped to synoviocytes of RA mice to find potential cell populations for Celastrol therapy.

The concept of what was once considered a \"wear and tear\" of articular cartilage is now that of an inflammation-related disease that affects over time the whole joint. The attention is increasingly focused on the synovium. Even from the earliest clinical stages, synovial inflammation (or synovitis) is a crucial factor involved in OA progression and a major player in pain onset. The release of inflammatory molecules in the synovium mediates disease progression and worsening of clinical features. The activation of synovial tissue-resident cells recalls innate immunity cells from the bloodstream, creating a proinflammatory milieu that fuels and maintains a damaging condition of low-grade inflammation in the joint. In such a context, cellular and molecular inflammatory behaviors in the synovium could be the <i>primum movens</i> of the structural and functional alterations of the whole joint.

Key findings include stage-dependent elevated levels of specific PLs and SLs in the SF, blood, and tissue of OA patients, implicating them as possible biomarkers of disease severity and progression. Studies suggest that beyond the involvement of these lipids in joint lubrication, individual species, such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) 16:0, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P), and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), contribute to pain, inflammation, and degradation of joints through various signaling pathways. Cross-species comparisons suggest that dogs and mice experience similar lipidomic changes during OA as humans, rendering them valuable models for studying lipid-related mechanisms. PLs and SLs in SF appear to originate primarily from the synovial blood capillaries through diffusion. In addition, lipids that are produced locally by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) are influenced by cytokines and growth factors that regulate the biosynthesis of PLs for joint lubrication.

Source documentation:\n   - For each key finding, provide structured citation: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID/DOI]\n   - Assess evidence quality (robust, preliminary, conflicting) for each relationship\n   - Note methodological strengths that increase confidence in findings\n\nRemember that your output will be used to enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation, so prioritize extracting clear entity relationships with directionality, mechanism details, and strength of evidence. Focus on relationship patterns that could reveal non-obvious connections in rheumatology pathogenesis or treatment response.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Although T and B cells have historically been central to the understanding of IIM immunopathology, monocytes and their differentiated progenitor cells, macrophages, are increasingly being recognized as critical mediators of both tissue damage and repair. In subtypes such as dermatomyositis, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy and antisynthetase syndrome, macrophages infiltrate skeletal muscle and other affected tissues, contributing to inflammation via production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species. Dysregulated interferon signaling, mitochondrial stress, and aberrant metabolic states in these cells further perpetuate tissue injury in IIMs. Conversely, certain macrophage subsets can support muscle fiber regeneration and dampen inflammation, underscoring the dual roles these cells can play. Future research into the heterogeneity of monocytes and macrophages, including single-cell transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches, will help clarify disease mechanisms, identify biomarkers of disease activity and prognosis, and guide novel therapeutic strategies targeting these innate immune cells in IIM.', 'pubYear': '2025', 'doi': '10.3389/fimmu.2025.1567833', 'authorString': 'Izuka S, Komai T, Tsuchida Y, Tsuchiya H, Okamura T, Fujio K.'}, {'title': 'Significant correlations of upregulated MPO expression with cytokine imbalance in ankylosing spondylitis patients and the inhibitory effect mediated by mesenchymal stem cells.', 'abstract': '<h4>Background</h4>Little is known regarding both the role of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the impact of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on inflammatory and immune responses in ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

Environmental inflammatory stimuli can induce maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), which promote differentiation and activation of effector T lymphocytes. We previously highlighted the role of extracellular microvesicles (EMVs) in pathogenesis by carrying antigens that trigger autoantibody production. In this investigation we verified whether EMVs may activate immature monocyte-derived DCs, inducing phenotypic and functional characteristics of mature DCs.<h4>Methods</h4>EMVs were obtained from 7 RA patients na\u00efve to biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and tested for their capability to activate DCs from healthy donors.<h4>Results</h4>We preliminary confirmed by western blot that carbamylated and citrullinated proteins are present in EMVs from RA patients. Moreover, surface marker phenotyping indicated that EMV treated-DCs exhibit increased expression of CD83 and CD86, as well as of CD83+ HLA-DR+ CD80+ CD86+ cells, indicating that the DCs are in a mature state. Furthermore, biochemical data demonstrated that EMVs from plasma of RA patients induce MAPK and NF-\u03baB activation in DCs. EMVs from the plasma of RA patients were also able to stimulate DCs to produce IL-12, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10, inducing a proinflammatory phenotype.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings demonstrate that EMVs from RA patients promote DC activation <i>in vitro</i>, suggesting a potential mechanism by which RA microenvironment perpetuates inflammation through the modulation of DC function.

We also evaluated the correlation between leukocyte numbers and expression of activation markers with disease activity parameters.<h4>Results</h4>SF PMNs showed an elevated activation state compared with blood PMNs, but a reduced activation state compared with oral PMNs of non-arthritic controls. In vitro stimulation caused SF PMNs to become further activated, demonstrating that they retain a reserve capacity for activation in response to specific triggers. We found significant variability between patients in the expression of SF PMN CD activation markers, indicating a range of possible activation states across patients. However, PMN CD marker expression remained consistent over two sequential visits in a subset of patients, indicating patient-specific distinct inflammatory states during flares.

Thus, we investigated how CRP impacts acute allograft rejection.<h4>Methods</h4>Prompted by clinical observations in facial VCAs, we employed a complex hindlimb transplantation model in rats to investigate the direct impact of CRP on transplant rejection.<h4>Results</h4>Our findings demonstrate that CRP expedites allograft rejection and diminishes allograft survival by selectively activating non-classical monocytes. Therapeutic stabilization of CRP abrogates this activating effect on monocytes, thereby attenuating acute allograft rejection. Intravital imagining of graft-infiltrating, recipient-derived monocytes during the early phase of acute rejection corroborated their differential regulation by CRP and their pivotal role in driving the initial stages of graft rejection.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The differential activation of recipient-derived monocytes by CRP exacerbates the innate immune response and accelerates clinical allograft rejection. Thus, therapeutic targeting of CRP represents a novel and promising strategy for preventing acute allograft rejection and potentially mitigating chronic allograft rejection.', 'pubYear': '2024', 'doi': '10.1016/j.jare.2024.07.007', 'authorString': 'Kiefer J, Zeller J, Schneider L, Thom\u00e9 J, McFadyen JD, Hoerbrand IA, Lang F, Deiss E, Bogner B, Schaefer AL, Chevalier N, Horner VK, Kreuzaler S, Kneser U, Kauke-Navarro M, Braig D, Woollard KJ, Pomahac B, Peter K, Eisenhardt SU.'}, {'title': 'Monocyte STAT1 phosphorylation and treatment response of JAK inhibitors in chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis.', 'abstract': '<h4>Background</h4>Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) is a rare autoinflammatory disease of unknown cause, predominantly affecting teens and young adults. The early diagnosis and management are challenging due to the lack of reliable diagnostic markers and the occasional intractable cases despite conventional anti-inflammatory treatments. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have recently shown potential utility; however, reports on their use for pediatric patients with CNO remain limited, and no established biomarkers exist to monitor disease activity. We aimed to investigate the pathophysiology of CNO and explore the rapid testing methods for accurate diagnosis and also assessing the disease activity.<h4>Methods</h4>We assessed intracellular phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (pSTAT1) in peripheral blood monocytes or T cells following interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3) stimulation, using flow cytometry in 9 patients under 15\\xa0years old with CNO. The pSTAT1 expression levels were compared with those in patients with STAT1-gain of function (STAT1-GOF) mutations (n\\u2009=\\u20095), other autoinflammatory diseases (n\\u2009=\\u20097), and healthy controls. Clinical and immunological data were monitored in 4 patients with intractable CNO treated with adjunctive JAK inhibitors, focusing on scoring scales, imaging data, lymphocyte subsets, cytokine profiles, and pSTAT1 levels.<h4>Results</h4>Monocyte pSTAT1 expression after IFN\u03b3 stimulation was elevated at diagnosis or during active CNO, similar to levels observed in STAT1-GOF cases. The pSTAT1 levels in CNO patients were significantly higher than those in other autoinflammatory diseases (p\\u2009=\\u20090.024) or controls (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Notably, pSTAT1 levels in CNO monocytes fluctuated with disease activity, decreasing in 5 patients during clinical remission following conventional therapies (p\\u2009=\\u20090.016). In four intractable cases, pSTAT1 levels remained high despite conventional treatments but significantly decreased after initiating JAK inhibitors (p\\u2009=\\u20090.036). This reduction correlated with improved patient pain visual analog scale (p\\u2009=\\u20090.008), CNO clinical disease activity score (p\\u2009=\\u20090.029), and better bone and joint imaging, though cytokine levels remained unchanged.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The monocyte pSTAT1 levels after IFN\u03b3 stimulation reflect the activity of CNO, indicating the diagnostic utility as well as the monitoring effect of disease control.

Earlier work reported that the complexes include at least part of the CD11a or CD11b chains containing the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 binding domain, and that sCD18 is capable of quantitatively competing with the cell membrane-bound form for ICAM-1 binding. However, it is not clear if the size differences between the sCD18 complexes reflect any functional variance regarding shedding from the cell membrane or binding to ICAM-1.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is the current standard of care for patients with acute coronary syndrome, providing significant reductions in cardiovascular (CV) events, albeit with an associated increased risk of bleeding. However, the high residual risk of recurrent events among these patients highlights the need for alternative strategies to treat and prevent atherothrombosis. To this extent, several approaches aimed at targeting atherothrombosis have been proposed. Among these, a strategy of dual-pathway inhibition simultaneously targeting platelets, using single or DAPT, and coagulation, using a low-dose anticoagulant such as rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily, has shown to reduce CV events but at the expense of increased bleeding. Targeting inflammatory pathways has the potential to be a highly effective strategy to tackle atherothrombosis without increasing bleeding risk.

This study aims to introduce new inflammatory ratios derived from hematological and lipid indices as discriminators of T-helper (Th)-1/Th-2 activity in RR-MS. Methods This cross-sectional study recruited 40 RR-MS patients and 30 healthy individuals. Th-1 and Th-2 cytokines, including interferon-y (INF-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-4, IL5, and IL-10 measurements, were performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Hematological indices and lipid profiles were measured as routine laboratory investigations. SPSS Statistics version 20 (IBM Corp. Released 2011. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) was used for data analysis. An independent sample t-test was used to compare two means, and Spearman correlation was used to assess the correlation between different markers. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Serum levels of Th-1 and Th-2 cytokines in RR-MS were significantly higher than in healthy subjects (p<0.001). The ratios of INF-\u03b3-to-IL4 and TNF-\u03b1-to-IL-10 were significantly lower than the corresponding ratios of healthy subjects (p<0.001).

Emerging preclinical data suggests activated EGC have beneficial roles in controlling gut pathophysiology. <h4>Objective</h4> Understanding EGC activation and adaptation during experimental and clinical IBD. <h4>Design</h4> We provide the first highly integrated approach to identify EGC activation signature in IBD. Profiling 390 samples from IBD patients via bulk and single-nucleus (sn) transcriptomics and replicate the findings on publicly available bulk and single-cell (sc) datasets from 1160 patients and 19,000 single EGC. Preclinical modelling of Th1/Th17 inflammation, reporter-assisted EGC sorting, analysis of regulated cell death, and Casp8 ablation in EGC was performed <h4>Results</h4> We identified novel IBD type and sampling associated EGC activation signature. Specific EGC activation markers were shared in biopsies and resection specimens, and were divergent between Crohn\u2019s disease and Ulcerative colitis. Preclinical modelling of intestinal inflammation identified combinatorial TNF and IFN-\u03b3-driven activation of EGC, associated with elevated necroptosis, and negatively impacting gut motility. Genetic-reporter-enabled sorting and downstream analyses confirmed TNF and IFN-\u03b3-driven EGC necroptosis, potentiated by Casp8 deficiency. Furthermore, snRNA-Seq from IBD patient samples confirmed elevated cell death signature in activated but not in rare neuroglia progenitor-like cluster. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Our findings identify IBD type-associated activated EGC markers involved in immune and epithelial homeoastasis. We uncover necroptosis of activated EGCs as a constituent of intestinal inflammation. Advancing our understanding of activated EGC survival is pivotal in elucidating their complex roles in maintaining gut immune-epithelial homeostasis. <h4>What is already known on this topic</h4> Activated EGC have emerged as important contributors in maintaining epithelial, immune and neuronal homeostasis. Increasing evidence from mouse studies points to the role of activated EGC in epithelial regeneration, tolerogenic T-cell activation, relaying psychological stress to the enteric nervous system, post-injury neurogenesis, and helminth clearance. Nevertheless, no consensus has emerged on what might define activated EGC in the context of IBD and how EGC turnover is affected in gut inflammation, limiting translation of their disease associated roles. <h4>What this study adds</h4> By combining bulk with single cell and single nucleus transcriptomes from IBD patients we identified new IBD type\u2013 and location-associated EGC activation signatures. Some of these are conserved with mouse EGC in gut inflammation models. We identified osteopontin an immunomodulator and Wnt6 an epithelial morphogen elevated in IBD EGC. We also identified IBD-associated EGC cell clusters, which display higher expression of cell death pathway transcripts. To investigate EGC turnover, we utilized preclinical models and found rapid EGC activation upon Th1/Th17 inflammation. This was associated with elevated EGC activation and caspase-independent necroptotic cell death. Ex vivo experiments showed a combinatorial requirement of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF in mediating EGC necroptosis. Our findings were replicated on multiple publicly available sc-RNA sequencing datasets from IBD patients. <h4>How this study might affect research, practice or policy</h4> Expanding on the available repertoire of EGC activation markers in IBD, both shared and unique to sampling procedure, disease type, and location will provide researchers with tools to identify EGC homeostasis during IBD. Moreover, the nature of the identified markers will stimulate research into specific EGC pathways triggered in inflammation. Adding to this, the rapid induction in pathological death of activated but not naive EGC upon IFN-\u03b3 and TNF stimulation will shed light on EGC adaptation and turnover.

Recent evidence described the involvement of the Wnt pathway in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Thus, we aimed to analyze some components of Wnt signaling, i.e. DKK1, Wnt 5a and \u03b2-catenin, and their association with disease activity indices, investigating possible differences between the two diseases.<h4>Methods</h4>Sera from 18 RA patients na\u00efve for biological therapy, 18 PsA patients and 20 matched healthy donors (HD) were tested for DKK1 by ELISA, Wnt 5a and \u03b2-catenin by Immunoblotting. Values were correlated with CTX-1, detected by ELISA, and with disease activity indices: Disease Activity Score on 28 joints (DAS28-CRP) for RA and the Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) score for PsA.<h4>Results</h4>This study highlights significant increase in DKK1, Wnt 5a, and \u03b2-catenin levels in RA and PsA patients compared to HD, with distinct patterns of correlation with disease activity indices.

Subgroup analysis revealed significant interactions between impaired pulmonary function and several factors, including body mass index (BMI), levels of physical activity, and diabetes status, in their associations with the risk of gout. RCS analysis showed a nonlinear relationship between pulmonary function indicators and gout incidence, characterized by an inverse S-shaped curve. Mediation analysis revealed that urate levels (49.1% mediation proportion), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (6.62%), monocyte counts (1.33%), and neutrophil counts (4.85%) significantly mediated the relationship between pulmonary function and the risk of gout.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study revealed a significant association between impaired pulmonary function and an increased risk of developing gout.

We collected plasma samples from FMF and PFAPA patients during the attack and the attack-free period.

We then analyzed the components of apoptosis and pyroptosis. The levels of sFasL (<i>p</i> = 0.035) and granzyme A (<i>p</i> = 0.038) in FMF patients were significantly increased during the attack period and decreased to levels comparable to HCs during the attack-free period.

This study investigated the effect and underlying mechanisms of one-carbon metabolism enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) on osteoclast differentiation and bone loss in RA.<h4>Methods</h4>The expression of MTHFD2 was examined in CD14\\u2009+\\u2009monocytes and murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). RNA-sequencing was performed to evaluate the regulatory mechanisms of MTHFD2 on osteoclastogenesis. Extracellular flux assay, JC-1 staining, and transmission electron microscopy were used to detect mitochondrial function and energy metabolism changes during osteoclast formation. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of MTHFD2 knockdown on bone loss. Bone volume and osteoclast counts were quantified by \u03bcCT and histomorphometry.<h4>Results</h4>Elevated MTHFD2 was observed in RA patients and CIA mice with a positive correlation to bone resorption parameters. During osteoclast formation, MTHFD2 was significantly upregulated in both human CD14\\u2009+\\u2009monocytes and murine BMMs. The application of MTHFD2 inhibitor and MTHFD2 knockdown suppressed osteoclastogenesis, while MTHFD2 overexpression promoted osteoclast differentiation in vitro. RNA-sequencing revealed that MTHFD2 inhibition blocked oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in osteoclasts, leading to decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and mitochondrial membrane potential without affecting mitochondrial biogenesis. Mechanistically, inhibition of MTHFD2 downregulated the expression of mitochondrial creatine kinase 1 (CKMT1), which in turn affected phosphocreatine energy shuttle and OXPHOS during osteoclastogenesis. Further, a therapeutic strategy to knock down MTHFD2 in knee joint in vivo ameliorated bone loss in CIA mice.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings demonstrate that MTHFD2 is upregulated in RA with relation to joint destruction. MTHFD2 promotes osteoclast differentiation and arthritic bone erosion by enhancing mitochondrial energy metabolism through CKMT1.

Although platelets have been suggested as one of these contributors through the release of their content during activation, there are limited specific data about their role as immune players in SLE.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Thirteen SLE patients were included. Flow cytometry was used to measure Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2, 4, and 9 in resting platelets, platelet-activation markers (PAC-1 binding, P-selectin, CD63, and CD40 ligand -L) and platelet-leukocyte aggregates before and after specific TLR stimulation. Soluble CD40L and von Willebrand factor (vWf) release from stimulated platelets was measured using ELISA.<h4>Results</h4>In resting conditions, SLE platelets showed normal expression levels of TLR 2, 4 and 9. Platelet surface activation markers, soluble CD40L, and vWf release were normal at baseline and after TLR stimulation. Platelet-monocyte aggregates were elevated in resting conditions in SLE samples and showed only a marginal increase after TLR stimulation, while baseline and stimulated platelet-neutrophil and platelet-lymphocyte aggregates were normal. C-reactive protein levels positively correlated with platelet-monocyte aggregates both at baseline and after stimulation with the TLR-2 agonist PAM3CSK4, suggesting these complexes could reflect the inflammatory activity in SLE. In our cohort, 12 of 13 patients received treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a known inhibitor of endosomal activity and a potential inhibitor of platelet activation. The fact that SLE platelets showed an adequate response to TLR agonists suggests that, despite this treatment, they retain the ability to respond to the increased levels of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which represent known TLR ligands, present in the circulation of SLE patients. Interestingly, elevated plasma levels of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a classical DAMP, correlated with vWf release from TLR-stimulated platelets, suggesting that HMGB1 may also be released by platelets, thereby creating a positive feedback loop for platelet activation that contributes to inflammation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study demonstrates normal platelet TLR expression and function together with increased circulating platelet-monocyte aggregates. In addition, a direct correlation was observed between plasma HMGB1 levels and platelet vWf release following TLR2 stimulation.

Additionally, the similarities and differences between OA and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in terms of diagnosis and immunotherapy need to be precisely understood, in order to draw lessons from or reject RA-based immunotherapies. To this end, this review summarizes the major triggers of inflammation in OA, the differentiation characteristics of key immune cell subsets, and compares the similarities and differences between OA and RA in diagnosis and treatment. It also outlines the current immunomodulatory strategies for OA and their limitations. Furthermore, we provide a detailed and focused discussion on immune cells that act as \"friends or foes\" in arthritis, covering the M1/M2 polarization of macrophages, functional heterogeneity of neutrophils, unique roles of dendritic cells at different maturation states, the balance between pro-inflammatory T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs), and the diverse functions of B cells, plasma cells, and regulatory B cells (Bregs) in OA.

Increased production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-13 by infiltrating macrophages and other inflammatory cells stimulate the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, resulting in activation of myofibroblasts and elevation of matrix metalloproteinases, leading to fistula formation.

In light of these challenges, natural bioactive compounds derived from plants, herbs, and other natural sources offer a promising alternative due to their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and tissue-regenerative properties. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms through which bioactive compounds, such as curcumin, resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), baicalin, carvacrol, berberine, essential oils, and Gum Arabic, exert therapeutic effects in periodontal disease. Bioactive compounds inhibit critical inflammatory pathways like NF-\u03baB, JAK/STAT, and MAPK while activating protective pathways such as Nrf2/ARE, reducing cytokine production and oxidative stress. They also inhibit the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), preventing tissue degradation and promoting healing.

Mechanistically, estrogen regulates osteoblast and osteoclast activity, thereby affecting bone turnover and maintenance of alveolar bone density. Studies indicate that estrogen upregulates the periodontal ligament stem cells' osteogenic differentiation (PDLSCs), promoting collagen synthesis and matrix mineralization critical for periodontal tissue integrity. Moreover, estrogen's anti-inflammatory properties modulate cytokine expression and immune responses in the periodontium, potentially attenuating periodontal inflammation and tissue destruction. Conversely, estrogen deficiency, such as in postmenopausal women, correlates with increased susceptibility to periodontal diseases characterized by greater clinical attachment loss and alveolar bone resorption. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen has shown promise in clinical settings, demonstrating beneficial effects on periodontal health by reducing inflammation and maintaining alveolar bone density. However, the adequacy and assurance of long-term estrogen supplementation in periodontal management require further investigation due to its systemic effects on other tissues and organs.

The BRB consists of the inner blood-retinal barrier (iBRB) and the outer blood-retinal barrier (oBRB), which are maintained by endothelial cells(ECs), pericytes(PCs), and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE), respectively. Their functions include regulating nutrient exchange, oxidative stress, and the immune microenvironment.

It is primarily responsible for the degradation of type IV and V collagen, fibronectin, laminin, and elastin, which are essential components of the ECM. MMP-2 is secreted as an inactive pro-enzyme (proMMP-2) and activated through proteolytic cleavage, with its activity being precisely regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Dysregulation of MMP-2 has been linked to a variety of pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetic complications, kidney diseases, and cancer. In cardiovascular diseases, it contributes to vascular remodeling, atherosclerosis, and aneurysms, while in fibrotic diseases, it mediates excessive ECM degradation leading to tissue scarring. In diabetes, elevated MMP-2 activity exacerbates complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease. In cancer, MMP-2 facilitates tumor invasion and metastasis by degrading ECM components and promoting angiogenesis.

In addition, obesity is closely linked to chronic kidney disease (CKD) by either exacerbating diabetic complications or directly causing kidney damage. Obesity-related CKD is characterized by proteinuria, lipid accumulation, fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis, which can gradually impair kidney function. Among the immune cells of the innate and adaptive immune response involved in the pathogenesis of obesity-related diseases, macrophages play a crucial role in the inflammation associated with CKD. In obese individuals, macrophages enter a pro-inflammatory state known as M1 polarization, which contributes to chronic inflammation. This polarization promotes tissue damage, inflammation and fibrosis, leading to progressive loss of kidney function. In addition, macrophage-induced oxidative stress is a key feature of CKD as it also promotes cell damage and inflammation. Macrophages also contribute to insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes by releasing inflammatory molecules that impair glucose metabolism, complicating the management of diabetes in obese patients. Hypertension and atherosclerosis, which are often associated with obesity, also contribute to the progression of CKD via immune and inflammatory pathways. Macrophages influence blood pressure regulation and contribute to vascular inflammation, particularly via the renin-angiotensin system. In atherosclerosis, macrophages accumulate in arterial plaques, leading to chronic inflammation and plaque instability, which may increase the risk of CVD in CKD patients.

The expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-13 were detected by RT-qPCR. Correlation analysis was carried out with clinical quantitative data such as preoperative erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT), and related blood routine indicators in the infection group.<h4>Results</h4>In the analysis between the infection group and the control group, MMP-13 was expressed in the diseased intervertebral disc tissue of STB patients, but the result was not statistically significant (P\\u2009=\\u20090.2172).

One of the most important factors contributing to the development and progression of cancer is the destruction of elements of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The most important substances involved in regulating the extracellular matrix degradation process are extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs). In the process of cancer cell migration, chemokines secreted by target tissues, as well as the profile of chemokine receptors presented on cancer cells, play a key role. In the presented work, five components of the TME were selected: MMP-2, MMP-7, TIMP-2, CXCL-9, and CXCL-10. In the years 2018-2021, peripheral blood samples were collected before the start of treatment and then on day 33 of intensive treatment from 31 patients diagnosed with ALL. The results indicate that the levels of MMP-2, MMP-7, and TIMP-2 did not statistically significantly change before and during treatment of ALL patients. The decrease in CXCL-9 and CXCL-10 levels in the patients' serum on the 33rd day of therapy turned out to be statistically significant. Our study indicates that serum is also a valuable material for the evaluation of these substances. Conclusions: CXCL-9 and CXCL-10 could be used as one of markers for monitoring the response to treatment and a potential marker of ALL recurrence in pediatric patients.

The NVU, a dynamic ensemble of astrocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia, is vital for maintaining cerebral homeostasis and regulating vascular brain development. Its structural integrity, particularly at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), depends on intercellular junctions and the basement membrane, which together restrict paracellular transport and shield the brain from systemic insults. Dysfunction in this intricate system is increasingly linked to pediatric stroke and related cerebrovascular conditions. Mutations disrupting endothelial cell adhesion or pericyte-endothelial interactions can compromise BBB stability, leading to pathological outcomes such as intraventricular hemorrhage in the germinal matrix, a hallmark of vascular brain immaturity.

Our previous study showed that in monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced OA rats, oral administration of heat-killed <i>Lactobacillus delbrueckii</i> subsp. <i>lactis</i> 557 (LDL557) could significantly decrease OA progression.<h4>Methods</h4>Accordingly, we designed an in vitro cell culture study aimed at investigating the effects of heat-killed LDL557 extracts on chondrocytes using SW1353 cells (a human chondrosarcoma cell line) challenged with 5 \u03bcM MIA to mimic OA conditions.<h4>Results</h4>The results showed that the 10 \u03bcg/mL LDL557 extracts protected SW1353 cells from MIA-induced death and reduced extracellular matrix (ECM) loss, as evaluated by toluidine blue O staining and extracellular matrix component synthesis with RT-qPCR measurement. This was achieved by decreasing the expression of MIA-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, while slightly increasing the MIA-suppressed expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which were evidenced by RT-qPCR analysis.

Additionally, the impact on extracellular matrix (ECM) components, particularly fibronectin, in relation to age-related histological and ultrastructural changes in lung tissues was investigated.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Lung tissues from old and young rats were subjected to activity-based probe profiling to assess the activity of different proteases. Expression levels of cathepsins G and X were quantified, and zymography was performed to evaluate matrix metalloproteinases activity. Furthermore, ECM components, specifically fibronectin, were examined for signs of degradation in the old lung tissues compared to the young ones.

Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) play a central role in RA, producing a significant amount of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-\u03b1 and IL-6, which promote inflammatory responses within the joints. Moreover, FLS exhibit tumor-like behavior, including aggressive proliferation and enhanced anti-apoptotic capabilities, which collectively drive chronic inflammation and joint damage in RA. TNF is a major pro-inflammatory cytokine that mediates a series of signaling pathways through its receptor TNFR1, including NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways, which are crucial for inflammation and cell survival in RA. The abnormal proliferation and anti-apoptotic characteristics of FLS in RA may result from dysregulation in TNF-mediated cell death pathways such as apoptosis and necroptosis. Ubiquitination is a critical post-translational modification regulating these signaling pathways. E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as cIAP1/2, promote the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins within the TNF receptor complex, modulating the signaling proteins. The high expression of the <i>BIRC3</i> gene and its encoded protein, cIAP2, in RA regulates various cellular processes, including apoptosis, inflammatory signaling, immune response, MAPK signaling, and cell proliferation, thereby promoting FLS survival and inflammatory responses. Inhibiting <i>BIRC3</i> expression can reduce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines by RA-FLS under both basal and inflammatory conditions and inhibit their proliferation.

Notably, the gene and protein expression levels of YTHDC1 and YTHDF2 were significantly reduced in the synovial tissue of RA patients. Furthermore, silencing YTHDC1 in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) significantly inhibited their migration, invasion, proliferation, and induced apoptosis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>YTHDC1 may potentially be involved in the pathogenesis of RA through its regulation of migration, invasion, proliferation, and apoptosis in FLSs.', 'pubYear': '2024', 'doi': '10.3389/fimmu.2024.1440398', 'authorString': 'Feng ZW, Yang CF, Xiao HF, Yuan F, Chen F, Zhang B, Zhang J, Tan M, Guo MG.'}, {'title': 'Blocking the Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor 2 (S1P<sub>2</sub>) Reduces the Severity of Collagen-Induced Arthritis in DBA-1J Mice.', 'abstract': 'The amount of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) found in the synovial tissue of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis is five times greater than that in those with osteoarthritis.

Despite the use of disease-modifying drugs, only about 50% of RA patients reach remission in real-world settings. We used an unbiased approach to investigate the effects of standard-of-care methotrexate (MTX) and a Janus kinase inhibitor, tofacitinib (TOFA), on gene expression in RA-FLS, in order to identify untargeted disease mediators.<h4>Methods</h4>Primary RA-FLS were activated by stimulation with interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) or platelet-derived growth factor\\u2009+\\u2009IL-1\u03b2 in the presence or absence of MTX or TOFA, with or without additional inhibitors. Co-cultures of synovial cells were performed in direct and indirect systems. Cells were collected for RNA sequencing or qPCR, and supernatants were analyzed for protein concentrations.<h4>Results</h4>Six thousand three hundred fifty genes were differentially expressed, the majority being upregulated, in MTX-treated activated RA-FLS and 970 genes, the majority being downregulated, in TOFA-treated samples. Pathway analysis showed that MTX had largest effects on 'Molecular mechanisms of cancer' and TOFA on 'Interferon signaling'. Targeted analysis of disease-associated genes revealed that MTX increased the expression of cell cycle-regulating genes but also of pro-inflammatory mediators like IL-1\u03b1 (IL1A) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, GM-CSF (CSF2). The MTX-promoted expression of CSF2 in activated RA-FLS peaked at 48\\xa0h, could be mediated via either NF-\u03baB or AP-1 transcription factors, and was abrogated by IL-1 inhibitors (IRAK4 inhibitor and anakinra). In a co-culture setting, MTX-treatment of activated RA-FLS induced IL1B expression in macrophages.<h4>Conclusions</h4>MTX treatment induces secretion of IL-1 from activated RA-FLS which by autocrine signaling augments their release of GM-CSF.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and co-expressed gene modules were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and the DESeq2 package. Enrichment analyses, including KEGG and Gene Ontology (GO) pathways, as well as immune cell infiltration profiling, were performed to explore shared biological pathways. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to pinpoint key genes linking PT and RA.

In addition to their well-established role in oncology, ADCs are currently demonstrating encouraging potential in addressing the unmet requirements in the treatment of autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

This review provides an overview of the RA pathogenesis, pre-existing therapies, and their limitations, the introduction of ADCs in RA treatment, the mechanism of ADCs, and a summary of ADCs in preclinical and clinical trials. Based on the literature we also propose a strategy in ADC synthesis, which may increase the efficiency in targeting multifactorial diseases like RA. We propose to utilize DMARDs (Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs), the first-line treatment for RA, as a payload for ADC synthesis. DMARDs are the only class of medication that limits the disease progression, but their efficacy is limited due to off-target toxicities. Hence, utilizing them as payload will help to deliver them directly at the targeted site, reducing their off-target toxicity, which in turn will increase their efficiency in targeting disease.

This study aimed to investigate the effects and potential underlying pathways of SBR on RA.<h4>Methods</h4>Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) induced inflammation in RA-derived fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS), and the expression of proinflammatory mediators was assessed using q-RT PCR and ELISA after treatment with various SBR concentrations. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were induced to differentiate into M1 and M2 macrophages, followed by treatment with various SBR concentrations and macrophage polarization assessment. Low-dose (0.5\\xa0mg/kg/d) and high-dose (2\\xa0mg/kg/d) SBR regimens were administered to a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model for 21 days, and the anti-arthritic effects of SBR were evaluated. Network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses were used to predict the anti-arthritic targets of SBR. The effect of SBR on the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway was evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>SBR suppressed macrophage polarization toward the M1 phenotype while enhancing their polarization toward the M2 phenotype. SBR reduced the levels of proinflammatory mediators in TNF-\u03b1-induced RA-FLS.

Autoantibodies against citrullinated IGF2BP1 are further detected in serum and synovial fluid samples from RA patients, which are positively correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and disease activity score 28 (DAS28).

The therapeutic effect of BMP9 on bone destruction was evaluated in a CIA mouse model through micro-CT imaging, histological analysis, and clinical scoring.

The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment, gene ontology (GO) enrichment, clusters of orthologous groups (COG), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were used to perform bioinformatics analysis of DEPs. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the key targets regulated by OHCT.<h4>Results</h4>According to TEM images, the average size of exosomes in body fluid of RA patients underwent OHCT was 76.13 nm (5.27E+10 /mL). The positive rates of CD9, CD63, and CD8 were detected on the surface of body fluid exosomes. A total of 300 DEPs (58 up-regulated and 242 down-regulated) were identified between the pre-treatment and post-treatment stages. DEPs were related mostly to protein binding, focal adhesion, extracellular region, post-translational modification and signal transduction. KEGG pathway analysis showed a significant enrichment of DEPs in PI3K-Akt pathway and focal adhesion. Ten DEGs (ITGA5, ITGA4, ENG, MMP14, SERPINH1, THY1, TAGLN, ITGA1, IGF1, and ITGB5) were considered target genes according to PPI network analysis. ELISA showed a slight decrease in the serum levels of CDK1, ITGA5, ITGB5, and CD44 during and after treatment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Body fluid samples from RA patients treated with oxhorn cupping contain exosomes.

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a microreticular structure formed after neutrophil death, have recently been implicated in RA pathogenesis and pathological mechanisms. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and key genes involved in NET formation in RA remain largely unknown.<h4>Methods</h4>We obtained single-cell RNA sequencing data of synovial tissues from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and performed cellular annotation and intercellular communication analyses. Subsequently, three microarray datasets were collected for a training cohort and correlated with a bulk RNA-seq dataset associated with NETs. Differentially expressed genes were identified, and weighted gene correlation network analysis was used to characterize gene association. Using three machine learning techniques, we identified the most important hub genes to develop and evaluate a nomogram diagnostic model. CIBERSORT was used to elucidate the relationship between hub genes and immune cells. An external validation dataset was used to verify pivotal gene expression and to construct co-regulatory networks using the NetworkAnalyst platform. We further investigated hub gene expression using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in an adjuvant-induced arthritis rat model and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in a clinical cohort.<h4>Results</h4>Seven cellular subpopulations were identified through downscaling and clustering, with neutrophils likely the most crucial cell clusters in RA. Intercellular communication analysis highlighted the network between neutrophils and fibroblasts. In this context, 4 key hub genes (CRYBG1, RMM2, MMP1, and SLC19A2) associated with NETs were identified. A nomogram model with a diagnostic value was developed and evaluated. Immune cell infiltration analysis indicated associations between the hub genes and the immune landscape in NETs and RA.

For all drugs tested in the low micromolar range (1-25 \u03bcM), sunitinib (as positive anti-angiogenetic control) showed marked inhibition of endothelial cell (EC) migration and sprouting, effectively reducing both scratch closure and sprout formation. Tofacitinib exhibited marginal effectiveness in the scratch assay, but performed better in the 3D models (55% inhibition), whereas NIKi showed around 50% anti-angiogenic effects in both models. Fluciclatide changed EC morphology rather than migration, and only when stimulated with synovial fluid in spheroid model did it show inhibitory effects (at \u22652.5 \u00b5M), with none below this dosage.

All cells of the immune system are governed by a complex and ever-changing gene expression program that is regulated through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. LncRNAs regulate gene expression within the cell nucleus by influencing transcription or through post-transcriptional processes that affect the splicing, stability, or translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Recent studies in immunology have revealed substantial alterations in the expression of lncRNAs during the activation of the innate immune system as well as the development, differentiation, and activation of T cells. These lncRNAs regulate key aspects of immune function, including the manufacturing of inflammatory molecules, cellular distinction, and cell movement. They do this by modulating protein-protein interactions or through base pairing with RNA and DNA.

The healing process runs in three main phases: inflammation, proliferation, and maturation/remodelling. While acute inflammation is indispensable for cleansing the wound, removing infection, and eliminating dead tissue characterised by the prevalence of neutrophils, the proliferation phase is characterised by transition into the inflammatory cell profile, shifting towards the prevalence of macrophages. The proliferation phase involves development of granulation tissue, comprising fibroblasts, activated myofibroblasts, and inflammatory and endothelial cells. Communication among these cellular components occurs through intercellular contacts, extracellular matrix secretion, as well as paracrine production of bioactive factors and proteolytic enzymes. The proliferation phase of healing is intricately regulated by inflammation, particularly interleukin-6. Prolonged inflammation results in dysregulations during the granulation tissue formation and may lead to the development of chronic wounds or hypertrophic/keloid scars. Notably, pathological processes such as autoimmune chronic inflammation, organ fibrosis, the tumour microenvironment, and impaired repair following viral infections notably share morphological and functional similarities with granulation tissue. Consequently, wound healing emerges as a prototype for understanding these diverse pathological processes.

A key feature in the development of joint disease is the overexpression of adhesion molecules, e.g., CD44. Expression of CD44 and its variants in the synovial tissues of patients with DJDs is strongly associated with cartilage damage and appears to be a predicting factor of synovial inflammation in DJDs. Targeting CD44 and its downstream signaling proteins has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy.

For example, markers like CTX-I and CTX-II reflect bone and cartilage turnover, respectively. Studies indicate elevated levels of certain markers post-bleeding episodes, suggesting joint health changes. However, longitudinal studies on collagen turnover and basement membrane or endothelial cell markers in relation to joint outcomes, particularly during painful episodes, are scarce. Given the role of the CX3CL1/CX3XR1 axis in arthritis, other studies investigate its involvement in HA. The importance of different inflammatory and bone damage biomarkers should be assessed, alongside articular cartilage and synovial membrane morphology, aiming to enhance understanding of hemophilic arthropathy progression.', 'pubYear': '2024', 'doi': '10.3390/ijms25189897', 'authorString': 'Badulescu OV, Scripcariu DV, Badescu MC, Ciocoiu M, Vladeanu MC, Plesoianu CE, Bojan A, Iliescu-Halitchi D, Tudor R, Huzum B, Frasinariu OE, Bararu-Bojan I.'}, {'title': 'Parvovirus B19 in Rheumatic Diseases.', 'abstract': 'Parvovirus B19 (B19V) is a human pathogen belonging to the <i>Parvoviridae</i> family. It is widely diffused in the population and responsible for a wide range of diseases, diverse in pathogenetic mechanisms, clinical course, and severity. B19V infects and replicates in erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) in the bone marrow leading to their apoptosis. Moreover, it can also infect, in an abortive manner, a wide set of different cell types, normally non-permissive, and modify their normal physiology. Differences in the characteristics of virus-cell interaction may translate into different pathogenetic mechanisms and clinical outcomes. Joint involvement is a typical manifestation of B19V infection in adults. Moreover, several reports suggest, that B19V could be involved in the pathogenesis of some autoimmune rheumatologic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), systemic sclerosis (SSc), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or vasculitis.

This review examines the perplexing functions of Par2, which promotes inflammation through immune cell activation while facilitating tissue healing in damaged organs. By analyzing findings across diverse autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease, we highlight how the context and location of Par2 activation determine its effects. Recent studies from our laboratory have resolved some of these contradictions by distinguishing Par2's immune-mediated inflammatory roles from its tissue-reparative functions. These insights pave the way for context-specific therapeutic strategies, such as selective Par2 modulators, that can mitigate inflammation while enhancing tissue repair. However, achieving such precision in modulation remains a significant challenge, necessitating further research into Par2's signaling pathways. This review underscores Par2's complexity and its transformative potential in autoimmune disease management, offering a nuanced perspective on its duality and therapeutic implications.\", 'pubYear': '2025', 'doi': '10.3390/ijms26010410', 'authorString': 'Khoon L, Piran R.'}, {'title': 'The Lung in Rheumatoid Arthritis\u2014Friend or Enemy?', 'abstract': '<NO ABSTRACT>', 'pubYear': '2024', 'doi': '<NO DOI>', 'authorString': 'Anton M, Cardoneanu A, Burlui A, Mihai I, Richter P, Bratoiu I, Macovei L, Rezus E.'}, {'title': 'CXCL7 enhances RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis via the activation of ERK/NFATc1 signaling pathway in inflammatory arthritis.', 'abstract': '<h4>Background</h4>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with anti-citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPA\\u2009+\\u2009RA) demonstrates more significant radiographic damage compared to ACPA-negative RA (ACPA- RA). Chemokine-activated signaling pathways contribute to the regulation of the bone formation and resorption. The potential role of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 7 (CXCL7) in bone erosion and its viability as a therapeutic target for RA merit further investigation.<h4>Methods</h4>Plasma CXCL7 concentration was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The effect of CXCL7 on receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogeneis was assessed through tartrate-resistant acid phosphates (TRAP) staining and F-actin ring immunofluorescence. Western blotting analysis was used to identify the signaling pathways activated by CXCL7. To investigate the potential therapeutic effect by targeting Cxcl7, Cxcl7 neutralizing antibodies were administrated intraperitoneally to mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Histopathology and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scanning were utilized to assess joint inflammation and bone destruction in CIA mice.<h4>Results</h4>The plasma CXCL7 concentration was significantly higher in ACPA\\u2009+\\u2009RA compared with ACPA- RA and healthy controls. The level of CXCL7 was positively correlated with disease activity and bone erosion in RA patients. It was discovered that CXCL7 promoted RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in CD14\\u2009+\\u2009monocytes derived from RA patients. Mechanistically, the addition of Cxcl7 significantly enhanced RANKL-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and NFATc1 expresssion. Cxcl7 neutralizing antibody alleviated arthritis severity in CIA by reducing the inflammatory response, osteoclasts numbers, and bone destruction in CIA mice joints.<h4>Conclusion</h4>CXCL7 contributes to the bone erosion in RA by enhancing RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis via the activation of ERK/NFATc1 signaling pathways.

in rheumatoid arthritis -> C-reactive protein -> monocyte activation -> pro-inflammatory cytokines -> matrix metalloproteinases -> extracellular matrix components -> fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis joints\n\n## CONTEXTUAL ONTOLOGY INFORMATION\nThe following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"In a recent exploration of the interaction dynamics within rheumatoid arthritis pathology, several findings highlight the pivotal roles of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) that regulate inflammatory responses and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which contribute to extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Synovial inflammation, particularly the modulation of monocyte activation and cytokine production, plays a significant role in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis.\\n\\n### Key Relationship Findings:\\n\\n1. **IL-1\\u0003b2 Regulation via Synovial Cells**: It was found that pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1\\u0003b2 significantly increase the gene and protein expression of MMP-3 and MMP-13 in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Resolvin D1 (RV-D1), an anti-inflammatory mediator, can mitigate this expression by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p-38, NF-\\u0003baB, and AKT pathways in the presence of IL-1\\u0003b2 [Yanoshita M. et al., \\\"Resolvin D1 suppresses inflammation in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n   \\n2. **Metabolic Reprogramming in FLS**: The mTOR pathways, alongside enhanced glycolysis in FLS, have been implicated in sustaining chronic inflammation and promoting joint degradation by augmenting the expression of MMPs, thereby accelerating cartilage breakdown [Henry \\u00192C. et al., \\\"Metabolic Reprogramming in Stromal and Immune Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n\\n3. **Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) as Therapeutic Tools**: EVs from mesenchymal stem cells have demonstrated potential to immunomodulate and transport influential cytokines altering the inflammatory state of FLS and cells within the rheumatic microenvironment, thus modifying the pathogenic progress of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [Chen P. et al., \\\"The interaction between EVs and ECM in joint diseases\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n\\n### Methodological Highlights:\\n- **Cellular Models**: Human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) activated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\\u0003b1) were used to study ECM degradation pathways and the impacts of anti-inflammatory agents.\\n- **Intracellular Signaling Analysis**: Evaluations of key signaling cascades such as AKT and NF-\\u0003baB pathways were conducted using Western blotting to ascertain their roles in inflammation and degradation processes in RA joints.\\n\\n### Methodological Strengths:\\n- **Multiple Pathway Analysis**: The studies employed comprehensive signaling pathway analysis to elucidate the molecular dynamics governing RA, strengthening the link between cytokine regulation and matrix degradation.\\n- **Innovative Therapeutic Exploration**: The examination of EVs adds a novel dimension to potential vector platforms for delivering therapeutic molecules to diseased synovial tissues.\\n\\nThese findings underscore the complexities of RA pathophysiology and point toward multi-faceted intervention strategies targeting FLS and the surrounding extracellular matrix. Combining metabolic modulation, cytokine signaling interruption, and EV-based therapeutics provides promising avenues for holistic management of rheumatoid arthritis.\",\n  \"justification\": \"The analysis focused on extracting detailed mechanistic interactions and validations that connect cytokine signaling, metabolic pathways, and the impact of cellular components like fibroblast-like synoviocytes and matrix metalloproteinases in rheumatoid arthritis. The roles of these pathways in regulating inflammation and ECM degradation were crucial for understanding underlying RA pathology. Experimental validation across multiple methodologies such as cellular modeling, signal pathway analysis, and EV utilization was necessary to corroborate potential therapeutic applications. Additionally, the synthesis from multiple interconnected studies provided a robust understanding, relevant to our task of enriching knowledge databases with high-fidelity relationship data, which is critical for advancing RA treatment approaches.\",\n  \"source_id\": \"Europe PMC\"\n}\n</ontology>\n"}], "output": [{"content": "{\n  \"agent_reasoning\": [\n    \"Reviewed the provided subgraph and identified the path from Bridge Therapy to fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) via acute flares, C-reactive protein (CRP), monocyte activation, pro-inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and extracellular matrix (ECM) components.\",\n    \"Noted that Bridge Therapy is used to manage acute flares, and that acute flares are associated with elevated CRP levels, which in turn induce monocyte activation and a cascade that promotes MMP expression and ECM degradation, ultimately affecting FLS activity in RA joints.\",\n    \"Integrated contextual ontology information showing that FLS activation, MMP regulation, and cytokine signaling (e.g., IL-1\u03b2) play crucial roles in RA pathogenesis along with references discussing metabolic reprogramming and modulation via resolvin D1 and EVs.\",\n    \"Formulated a hypothesis linking the modulation of acute flares by Bridge Therapy to a downstream reduction in CRP-mediated monocyte activation and pro-inflammatory cascade impacting FLS, positing a novel mechanism by which Bridge Therapy might exert protective joint effects.\",\n    \"The selected mechanism is biologically plausible given known roles of CRP, cytokines, and MMPs in ECM degradation, and it is specific enough to be testable with measurable outcomes, thus fulfilling the evaluation criteria.\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"Bridge Therapy Modulates the CRP\u2013Cytokine\u2013MMP\u2013ECM Axis to Regulate Fibroblast-like Synoviocyte Activation in RA\",\n  \"statement\": \"We hypothesize that in rheumatoid arthritis, Bridge Therapy mitigates acute flares, leading to reduced elevation of C-reactive protein which in turn dampens monocyte activation and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokine production; this cascade results in lower expression of matrix metalloproteinases, preserving extracellular matrix integrity and thereby modulating the aberrant activation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in RA joints.\",\n  \"summary\": \"Bridge Therapy may exert protective effects in rheumatoid arthritis by interfering with the acute flare-induced CRP cascade that activates monocytes and triggers a pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade, resulting in diminished MMP production and preservation of ECM that regulates fibroblast-like synoviocyte activity.\",\n  \"source_subgraph\": [\n    \"Bridge Therapy -> acute flares in rheumatoid arthritis -> C-reactive protein -> monocyte activation -> pro-inflammatory cytokines -> matrix metalloproteinases -> extracellular matrix components -> fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis joints\"\n  ],\n  \"mechanism\": {\n    \"pathway_description\": \"Bridge Therapy reduces the frequency or severity of acute inflammatory flares in RA, which leads to lower C-reactive protein levels.

rheumatoid arthritis joints\n\n## CONTEXTUAL ONTOLOGY INFORMATION\nThe following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"In a recent exploration of the interaction dynamics within rheumatoid arthritis pathology, several findings highlight the pivotal roles of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) that regulate inflammatory responses and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which contribute to extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Synovial inflammation, particularly the modulation of monocyte activation and cytokine production, plays a significant role in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis.\\n\\n### Key Relationship Findings:\\n\\n1. **IL-1\\u0003b2 Regulation via Synovial Cells**: It was found that pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1\\u0003b2 significantly increase the gene and protein expression of MMP-3 and MMP-13 in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Resolvin D1 (RV-D1), an anti-inflammatory mediator, can mitigate this expression by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p-38, NF-\\u0003baB, and AKT pathways in the presence of IL-1\\u0003b2 [Yanoshita M. et al., \\\"Resolvin D1 suppresses inflammation in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n   \\n2. **Metabolic Reprogramming in FLS**: The mTOR pathways, alongside enhanced glycolysis in FLS, have been implicated in sustaining chronic inflammation and promoting joint degradation by augmenting the expression of MMPs, thereby accelerating cartilage breakdown [Henry \\u00192C. et al., \\\"Metabolic Reprogramming in Stromal and Immune Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n\\n3. **Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) as Therapeutic Tools**: EVs from mesenchymal stem cells have demonstrated potential to immunomodulate and transport influential cytokines altering the inflammatory state of FLS and cells within the rheumatic microenvironment, thus modifying the pathogenic progress of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [Chen P. et al., \\\"The interaction between EVs and ECM in joint diseases\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n\\n### Methodological Highlights:\\n- **Cellular Models**: Human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) activated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\\u0003b1) were used to study ECM degradation pathways and the impacts of anti-inflammatory agents.\\n- **Intracellular Signaling Analysis**: Evaluations of key signaling cascades such as AKT and NF-\\u0003baB pathways were conducted using Western blotting to ascertain their roles in inflammation and degradation processes in RA joints.\\n\\n### Methodological Strengths:\\n- **Multiple Pathway Analysis**: The studies employed comprehensive signaling pathway analysis to elucidate the molecular dynamics governing RA, strengthening the link between cytokine regulation and matrix degradation.\\n- **Innovative Therapeutic Exploration**: The examination of EVs adds a novel dimension to potential vector platforms for delivering therapeutic molecules to diseased synovial tissues.\\n\\nThese findings underscore the complexities of RA pathophysiology and point toward multi-faceted intervention strategies targeting FLS and the surrounding extracellular matrix. Combining metabolic modulation, cytokine signaling interruption, and EV-based therapeutics provides promising avenues for holistic management of rheumatoid arthritis.\",\n  \"justification\": \"The analysis focused on extracting detailed mechanistic interactions and validations that connect cytokine signaling, metabolic pathways, and the impact of cellular components like fibroblast-like synoviocytes and matrix metalloproteinases in rheumatoid arthritis. The roles of these pathways in regulating inflammation and ECM degradation were crucial for understanding underlying RA pathology. Experimental validation across multiple methodologies such as cellular modeling, signal pathway analysis, and EV utilization was necessary to corroborate potential therapeutic applications.

rheumatoid arthritis joints\n\n## CONTEXTUAL ONTOLOGY INFORMATION\nThe following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"In a recent exploration of the interaction dynamics within rheumatoid arthritis pathology, several findings highlight the pivotal roles of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) that regulate inflammatory responses and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which contribute to extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Synovial inflammation, particularly the modulation of monocyte activation and cytokine production, plays a significant role in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis.\\n\\n### Key Relationship Findings:\\n\\n1. **IL-1\\u0003b2 Regulation via Synovial Cells**: It was found that pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1\\u0003b2 significantly increase the gene and protein expression of MMP-3 and MMP-13 in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Resolvin D1 (RV-D1), an anti-inflammatory mediator, can mitigate this expression by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p-38, NF-\\u0003baB, and AKT pathways in the presence of IL-1\\u0003b2 [Yanoshita M. et al., \\\"Resolvin D1 suppresses inflammation in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n   \\n2. **Metabolic Reprogramming in FLS**: The mTOR pathways, alongside enhanced glycolysis in FLS, have been implicated in sustaining chronic inflammation and promoting joint degradation by augmenting the expression of MMPs, thereby accelerating cartilage breakdown [Henry \\u00192C. et al., \\\"Metabolic Reprogramming in Stromal and Immune Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n\\n3. **Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) as Therapeutic Tools**: EVs from mesenchymal stem cells have demonstrated potential to immunomodulate and transport influential cytokines altering the inflammatory state of FLS and cells within the rheumatic microenvironment, thus modifying the pathogenic progress of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [Chen P. et al., \\\"The interaction between EVs and ECM in joint diseases\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n\\n### Methodological Highlights:\\n- **Cellular Models**: Human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) activated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\\u0003b1) were used to study ECM degradation pathways and the impacts of anti-inflammatory agents.\\n- **Intracellular Signaling Analysis**: Evaluations of key signaling cascades such as AKT and NF-\\u0003baB pathways were conducted using Western blotting to ascertain their roles in inflammation and degradation processes in RA joints.\\n\\n### Methodological Strengths:\\n- **Multiple Pathway Analysis**: The studies employed comprehensive signaling pathway analysis to elucidate the molecular dynamics governing RA, strengthening the link between cytokine regulation and matrix degradation.\\n- **Innovative Therapeutic Exploration**: The examination of EVs adds a novel dimension to potential vector platforms for delivering therapeutic molecules to diseased synovial tissues.\\n\\nThese findings underscore the complexities of RA pathophysiology and point toward multi-faceted intervention strategies targeting FLS and the surrounding extracellular matrix. Combining metabolic modulation, cytokine signaling interruption, and EV-based therapeutics provides promising avenues for holistic management of rheumatoid arthritis.\",\n  \"justification\": \"The analysis focused on extracting detailed mechanistic interactions and validations that connect cytokine signaling, metabolic pathways, and the impact of cellular components like fibroblast-like synoviocytes and matrix metalloproteinases in rheumatoid arthritis. The roles of these pathways in regulating inflammation and ECM degradation were crucial for understanding underlying RA pathology. Experimental validation across multiple methodologies such as cellular modeling, signal pathway analysis, and EV utilization was necessary to corroborate potential therapeutic applications. Additionally, the synthesis from multiple interconnected studies provided a robust understanding, relevant to our task of enriching knowledge databases with high-fidelity relationship data, which is critical for advancing RA treatment approaches.\",\n  \"source_id\": \"Europe PMC\"\n}\n</ontology>\n"}], "output": [{"content": "{\n  \"agent_reasoning\": [\n    \"I began by mapping the provided subgraph, noting the chain from Bridge Therapy to fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis joints, and highlighted the intermediary roles of acute flares, C-reactive protein, monocyte activation, pro-inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases, and extracellular matrix components.\",\n    \"I recognized that bridge therapy is used to manage acute flares, which are associated with elevated CRP.

in rheumatoid arthritis -> C-reactive protein -> monocyte activation -> pro-inflammatory cytokines -> matrix metalloproteinases -> extracellular matrix components -> fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis joints\n\n## CONTEXTUAL ONTOLOGY INFORMATION\nThe following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"In a recent exploration of the interaction dynamics within rheumatoid arthritis pathology, several findings highlight the pivotal roles of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) that regulate inflammatory responses and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which contribute to extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Synovial inflammation, particularly the modulation of monocyte activation and cytokine production, plays a significant role in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis.\\n\\n### Key Relationship Findings:\\n\\n1. **IL-1\\u0003b2 Regulation via Synovial Cells**: It was found that pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1\\u0003b2 significantly increase the gene and protein expression of MMP-3 and MMP-13 in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Resolvin D1 (RV-D1), an anti-inflammatory mediator, can mitigate this expression by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p-38, NF-\\u0003baB, and AKT pathways in the presence of IL-1\\u0003b2 [Yanoshita M. et al., \\\"Resolvin D1 suppresses inflammation in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n   \\n2. **Metabolic Reprogramming in FLS**: The mTOR pathways, alongside enhanced glycolysis in FLS, have been implicated in sustaining chronic inflammation and promoting joint degradation by augmenting the expression of MMPs, thereby accelerating cartilage breakdown [Henry \\u00192C. et al., \\\"Metabolic Reprogramming in Stromal and Immune Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n\\n3. **Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) as Therapeutic Tools**: EVs from mesenchymal stem cells have demonstrated potential to immunomodulate and transport influential cytokines altering the inflammatory state of FLS and cells within the rheumatic microenvironment, thus modifying the pathogenic progress of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [Chen P. et al., \\\"The interaction between EVs and ECM in joint diseases\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n\\n### Methodological Highlights:\\n- **Cellular Models**: Human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) activated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\\u0003b1) were used to study ECM degradation pathways and the impacts of anti-inflammatory agents.\\n- **Intracellular Signaling Analysis**: Evaluations of key signaling cascades such as AKT and NF-\\u0003baB pathways were conducted using Western blotting to ascertain their roles in inflammation and degradation processes in RA joints.\\n\\n### Methodological Strengths:\\n- **Multiple Pathway Analysis**: The studies employed comprehensive signaling pathway analysis to elucidate the molecular dynamics governing RA, strengthening the link between cytokine regulation and matrix degradation.\\n- **Innovative Therapeutic Exploration**: The examination of EVs adds a novel dimension to potential vector platforms for delivering therapeutic molecules to diseased synovial tissues.\\n\\nThese findings underscore the complexities of RA pathophysiology and point toward multi-faceted intervention strategies targeting FLS and the surrounding extracellular matrix. Combining metabolic modulation, cytokine signaling interruption, and EV-based therapeutics provides promising avenues for holistic management of rheumatoid arthritis.\",\n  \"justification\": \"The analysis focused on extracting detailed mechanistic interactions and validations that connect cytokine signaling, metabolic pathways, and the impact of cellular components like fibroblast-like synoviocytes and matrix metalloproteinases in rheumatoid arthritis.

Experimental validation across multiple methodologies such as cellular modeling, signal pathway analysis, and EV utilization was necessary to corroborate potential therapeutic applications.

rheumatoid arthritis joints\n\n## CONTEXTUAL ONTOLOGY INFORMATION\nThe following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"In a recent exploration of the interaction dynamics within rheumatoid arthritis pathology, several findings highlight the pivotal roles of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) that regulate inflammatory responses and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which contribute to extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Synovial inflammation, particularly the modulation of monocyte activation and cytokine production, plays a significant role in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis.\\n\\n### Key Relationship Findings:\\n\\n1. **IL-1\\u0003b2 Regulation via Synovial Cells**: It was found that pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1\\u0003b2 significantly increase the gene and protein expression of MMP-3 and MMP-13 in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Resolvin D1 (RV-D1), an anti-inflammatory mediator, can mitigate this expression by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p-38, NF-\\u0003baB, and AKT pathways in the presence of IL-1\\u0003b2 [Yanoshita M. et al., \\\"Resolvin D1 suppresses inflammation in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n   \\n2. **Metabolic Reprogramming in FLS**: The mTOR pathways, alongside enhanced glycolysis in FLS, have been implicated in sustaining chronic inflammation and promoting joint degradation by augmenting the expression of MMPs, thereby accelerating cartilage breakdown [Henry \\u00192C. et al., \\\"Metabolic Reprogramming in Stromal and Immune Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n\\n3. **Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) as Therapeutic Tools**: EVs from mesenchymal stem cells have demonstrated potential to immunomodulate and transport influential cytokines altering the inflammatory state of FLS and cells within the rheumatic microenvironment, thus modifying the pathogenic progress of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [Chen P. et al., \\\"The interaction between EVs and ECM in joint diseases\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n\\n### Methodological Highlights:\\n- **Cellular Models**: Human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) activated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\\u0003b1) were used to study ECM degradation pathways and the impacts of anti-inflammatory agents.\\n- **Intracellular Signaling Analysis**: Evaluations of key signaling cascades such as AKT and NF-\\u0003baB pathways were conducted using Western blotting to ascertain their roles in inflammation and degradation processes in RA joints.\\n\\n### Methodological Strengths:\\n- **Multiple Pathway Analysis**: The studies employed comprehensive signaling pathway analysis to elucidate the molecular dynamics governing RA, strengthening the link between cytokine regulation and matrix degradation.\\n- **Innovative Therapeutic Exploration**: The examination of EVs adds a novel dimension to potential vector platforms for delivering therapeutic molecules to diseased synovial tissues.\\n\\nThese findings underscore the complexities of RA pathophysiology and point toward multi-faceted intervention strategies targeting FLS and the surrounding extracellular matrix. Combining metabolic modulation, cytokine signaling interruption, and EV-based therapeutics provides promising avenues for holistic management of rheumatoid arthritis.\",\n  \"justification\": \"The analysis focused on extracting detailed mechanistic interactions and validations that connect cytokine signaling, metabolic pathways, and the impact of cellular components like fibroblast-like synoviocytes and matrix metalloproteinases in rheumatoid arthritis. The roles of these pathways in regulating inflammation and ECM degradation were crucial for understanding underlying RA pathology. Experimental validation across multiple methodologies such as cellular modeling, signal pathway analysis, and EV utilization was necessary to corroborate potential therapeutic applications. Additionally, the synthesis from multiple interconnected studies provided a robust understanding, relevant to our task of enriching knowledge databases with high-fidelity relationship data, which is critical for advancing RA treatment approaches.\",\n  \"source_id\": \"Europe PMC\"\n}\n</ontology>\n"}], "output": [{"content": "{\n  \"agent_reasoning\": [\n    \"Initial observation of the subgraph revealed a clear cascade from Bridge Therapy through acute flares, CRP elevation, monocyte activation, cytokine production, MMP expression, ECM degradation, and ultimately modulation of fibroblast\u2010like synoviocytes in RA joints.\",\n    \"Key connections linking CRP-mediated monocyte activation to downstream cytokine release and MMP-driven ECM degradation were identified as pivotal in influencing FLS behavior.\",\n    \"Alternative mechanisms such as direct cytokine effects on FLS were considered but the novel focus on how bridge therapy may indirectly modulate FLS through this inflammatory cascade was deemed both novel and clinically relevant.\",\n    \"Integration of additional ontological data regarding IL-1\u03b2, signaling pathways (e.g., NF-kB, AKT), and metabolic reprogramming reinforced the biological plausibility of targeting this cascade.\",\n    \"The selected mechanism bridges therapeutic interventions (bridge therapy) to molecular inflammatory events in RA, aligning with criteria for novelty, specificity, testability, and clinical relevance.\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"Bridge Therapy Modulates Fibroblast-Like Synoviocyte Activation via a CRP-Driven Inflammatory Cascade in Rheumatoid Arthritis\",\n  \"statement\": \"We hypothesize that optimizing bridge therapy in rheumatoid arthritis patients reduces acute inflammatory flares, leading to stabilized CRP levels and attenuated monocyte activation, which together decrease pro-inflammatory cytokine release and subsequent matrix metalloproteinase induction.

rheumatoid arthritis joints\n\n## CONTEXTUAL ONTOLOGY INFORMATION\nThe following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"In a recent exploration of the interaction dynamics within rheumatoid arthritis pathology, several findings highlight the pivotal roles of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) that regulate inflammatory responses and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which contribute to extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Synovial inflammation, particularly the modulation of monocyte activation and cytokine production, plays a significant role in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis.\\n\\n### Key Relationship Findings:\\n\\n1. **IL-1\\u0003b2 Regulation via Synovial Cells**: It was found that pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1\\u0003b2 significantly increase the gene and protein expression of MMP-3 and MMP-13 in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Resolvin D1 (RV-D1), an anti-inflammatory mediator, can mitigate this expression by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p-38, NF-\\u0003baB, and AKT pathways in the presence of IL-1\\u0003b2 [Yanoshita M. et al., \\\"Resolvin D1 suppresses inflammation in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n   \\n2. **Metabolic Reprogramming in FLS**: The mTOR pathways, alongside enhanced glycolysis in FLS, have been implicated in sustaining chronic inflammation and promoting joint degradation by augmenting the expression of MMPs, thereby accelerating cartilage breakdown [Henry \\u00192C. et al., \\\"Metabolic Reprogramming in Stromal and Immune Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n\\n3. **Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) as Therapeutic Tools**: EVs from mesenchymal stem cells have demonstrated potential to immunomodulate and transport influential cytokines altering the inflammatory state of FLS and cells within the rheumatic microenvironment, thus modifying the pathogenic progress of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [Chen P. et al., \\\"The interaction between EVs and ECM in joint diseases\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n\\n### Methodological Highlights:\\n- **Cellular Models**: Human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) activated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\\u0003b1) were used to study ECM degradation pathways and the impacts of anti-inflammatory agents.\\n- **Intracellular Signaling Analysis**: Evaluations of key signaling cascades such as AKT and NF-\\u0003baB pathways were conducted using Western blotting to ascertain their roles in inflammation and degradation processes in RA joints.\\n\\n### Methodological Strengths:\\n- **Multiple Pathway Analysis**: The studies employed comprehensive signaling pathway analysis to elucidate the molecular dynamics governing RA, strengthening the link between cytokine regulation and matrix degradation.\\n- **Innovative Therapeutic Exploration**: The examination of EVs adds a novel dimension to potential vector platforms for delivering therapeutic molecules to diseased synovial tissues.\\n\\nThese findings underscore the complexities of RA pathophysiology and point toward multi-faceted intervention strategies targeting FLS and the surrounding extracellular matrix. Combining metabolic modulation, cytokine signaling interruption, and EV-based therapeutics provides promising avenues for holistic management of rheumatoid arthritis.\",\n  \"justification\": \"The analysis focused on extracting detailed mechanistic interactions and validations that connect cytokine signaling, metabolic pathways, and the impact of cellular components like fibroblast-like synoviocytes and matrix metalloproteinases in rheumatoid arthritis. The roles of these pathways in regulating inflammation and ECM degradation were crucial for understanding underlying RA pathology. Experimental validation across multiple methodologies such as cellular modeling, signal pathway analysis, and EV utilization was necessary to corroborate potential therapeutic applications. Additionally, the synthesis from multiple interconnected studies provided a robust understanding, relevant to our task of enriching knowledge databases with high-fidelity relationship data, which is critical for advancing RA treatment approaches.\",\n  \"source_id\": \"Europe PMC\"\n}\n</ontology>\n"}], "output": [{"content": "{\n  \"agent_reasoning\": [\n    \"Analyzed the subgraph and identified a cascade that links Bridge Therapy with fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) activity via acute flares, C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation, monocyte activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling.\",\n    \"Focused on the role of Bridge Therapy in managing acute flares to hypothesize that reducing these flares might lower CRP levels, subsequently dampening monocyte activation and cytokine release, ultimately reducing MMP-mediated ECM degradation and modulating FLS behavior.\",\n    \"Considered alternative cascades but selected the detailed inflammatory-matrix remodeling pathway due to its clear mechanistic underpinning and its potential for targeted therapeutic intervention.\",\n    \"Ensured that the hypothesis meets criteria for novelty, biological plausibility, specificity, testability, clinical relevance, and falsifiability.\",\n    \"Integrated relevant ontological context regarding cytokine signaling, FLS behavior, and ECM interactions to strengthen and validate the proposed mechanism.\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"Bridge Therapy Modulates Fibroblast-Like Synoviocyte Activity via Inflammation-Driven ECM Remodeling in Rheumatoid Arthritis\",\n  \"statement\": \"Optimized bridge therapy, by effectively managing acute rheumatoid arthritis flares, is hypothesized to lower C-reactive protein levels, which in turn reduces monocyte activation and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

rheumatoid arthritis joints\n\n## CONTEXTUAL ONTOLOGY INFORMATION\nThe following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"In a recent exploration of the interaction dynamics within rheumatoid arthritis pathology, several findings highlight the pivotal roles of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) that regulate inflammatory responses and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which contribute to extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Synovial inflammation, particularly the modulation of monocyte activation and cytokine production, plays a significant role in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis.\\n\\n### Key Relationship Findings:\\n\\n1. **IL-1\\u0003b2 Regulation via Synovial Cells**: It was found that pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1\\u0003b2 significantly increase the gene and protein expression of MMP-3 and MMP-13 in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Resolvin D1 (RV-D1), an anti-inflammatory mediator, can mitigate this expression by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p-38, NF-\\u0003baB, and AKT pathways in the presence of IL-1\\u0003b2 [Yanoshita M. et al., \\\"Resolvin D1 suppresses inflammation in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n   \\n2. **Metabolic Reprogramming in FLS**: The mTOR pathways, alongside enhanced glycolysis in FLS, have been implicated in sustaining chronic inflammation and promoting joint degradation by augmenting the expression of MMPs, thereby accelerating cartilage breakdown [Henry \\u00192C. et al., \\\"Metabolic Reprogramming in Stromal and Immune Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n\\n3. **Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) as Therapeutic Tools**: EVs from mesenchymal stem cells have demonstrated potential to immunomodulate and transport influential cytokines altering the inflammatory state of FLS and cells within the rheumatic microenvironment, thus modifying the pathogenic progress of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [Chen P. et al., \\\"The interaction between EVs and ECM in joint diseases\\\", 2025, PubMed].\\n\\n### Methodological Highlights:\\n- **Cellular Models**: Human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) activated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\\u0003b1) were used to study ECM degradation pathways and the impacts of anti-inflammatory agents.\\n- **Intracellular Signaling Analysis**: Evaluations of key signaling cascades such as AKT and NF-\\u0003baB pathways were conducted using Western blotting to ascertain their roles in inflammation and degradation processes in RA joints.\\n\\n### Methodological Strengths:\\n- **Multiple Pathway Analysis**: The studies employed comprehensive signaling pathway analysis to elucidate the molecular dynamics governing RA, strengthening the link between cytokine regulation and matrix degradation.\\n- **Innovative Therapeutic Exploration**: The examination of EVs adds a novel dimension to potential vector platforms for delivering therapeutic molecules to diseased synovial tissues.\\n\\nThese findings underscore the complexities of RA pathophysiology and point toward multi-faceted intervention strategies targeting FLS and the surrounding extracellular matrix. Combining metabolic modulation, cytokine signaling interruption, and EV-based therapeutics provides promising avenues for holistic management of rheumatoid arthritis.\",\n  \"justification\": \"The analysis focused on extracting detailed mechanistic interactions and validations that connect cytokine signaling, metabolic pathways, and the impact of cellular components like fibroblast-like synoviocytes and matrix metalloproteinases in rheumatoid arthritis. The roles of these pathways in regulating inflammation and ECM degradation were crucial for understanding underlying RA pathology. Experimental validation across multiple methodologies such as cellular modeling, signal pathway analysis, and EV utilization was necessary to corroborate potential therapeutic applications. Additionally, the synthesis from multiple interconnected studies provided a robust understanding, relevant to our task of enriching knowledge databases with high-fidelity relationship data, which is critical for advancing RA treatment approaches.\",\n  \"source_id\": \"Europe PMC\"\n}\n</ontology>\n"}], "output": [{"content": "{\n  \"agent_reasoning\": [\n    \"We began by examining the provided subgraph where Bridge Therapy is connected to fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) via a cascade involving acute flares, CRP elevation, monocyte activation, pro-inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases, and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation.\",\n    \"The subgraph indicated that Bridge Therapy is used to manage acute flares, suggesting that its modulation may extend beyond immediate symptom relief.\",\n    \"By following the chain, we recognized that elevated CRP levels during acute flares induce monocyte activation, which in turn elevates pro-inflammatory cytokines that stimulate MMP expression leading to ECM degradation. The altered ECM then regulates FLS activity, fostering an inflammatory microenvironment in RA joints.\",\n    \"Integration with the additional ontology information emphasized that cytokine-driven activation of MMPs, particularly through IL-1\u03b2 signaling, and metabolic reprogramming in FLS (via pathways like mTOR and glycolysis) are key in RA pathology.\",\n    \"Considering alternative explanations, we also noted that direct cytokine inhibition may help; however, our hypothesis uniquely connects therapeutic modulation via Bridge Therapy with a downstream impact on ECM-FLS interactions.\",\n    \"The hypothesis was refined to propose that optimized Bridge Therapy reduces CRP levels, thereby disrupting this inflammatory cascade and mitigating FLS reactivation, which not only addresses acute flares but may also modify long-term joint destruction.\",\n    \"This hypothesis is novel, biologically plausible, specific, testable, clinically relevant, and falsifiable.\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"Bridge Therapy Modulates CRP-Driven Inflammatory Cascade to Attenuate FLS-Mediated Joint Damage in RA\",\n  \"statement\": \"We hypothesize that optimized Bridge Therapy in rheumatoid arthritis patients reduces acute flare-induced CRP levels, thereby dampening monocyte activation and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

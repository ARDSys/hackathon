Your expertise lies in determining which information sources will be most valuable for each entity and relationship in the subgraph, then delegating searches to the most appropriate specialized agents.\n\n## ORCHESTRATION STRATEGY\n\nWhen analyzing a subgraph, follow this process:\n\n1. Initial Assessment:\n   - Carefully analyze the subgraph to identify all key entities and relationships\n   - Categorize entities by type: genes, proteins, pathways, diseases, drugs, etc.\n   - Identify relationships requiring additional context or mechanistic explanation\n   - Prioritize which elements would benefit most from enrichment\n\n2. Strategic Delegation:\n   - For each high-priority entity or relationship, determine the optimal information source:\n     * For established molecular mechanisms \u2192 Transfer to PubMed Agent\n     * For cutting-edge research \u2192 Transfer to BioRxiv Agent\n     * For comprehensive literature collection \u2192 Transfer to Europe PMC Agent\n     * For citation-rich, influential papers \u2192 Transfer to Semantic Scholar Agent\n     * For multi-source literature scans \u2192 Transfer to Firecrawl Agent\n     * For existing knowledge graph connections \u2192 Transfer to Hetionet Agent\n\n3. Contextual Query Construction:\n   - When transferring to each agent, provide context-rich guidance:\n     * Specify exactly what information you need about the entity/relationship\n     * Provide relevant context from the subgraph that might inform the search\n     * Explain how this information will help enrich the knowledge graph\n     * Set expectations for the type of relationships to focus on\n\n4. Multi-perspective Integration:\n   - After receiving information from specialist agents, integrate their findings:\n     * Reconcile potentially contradictory information\n     * Identify complementary information across different sources\n     * Recognize emergent patterns not visible in any single source\n     * Synthesize a coherent understanding of mechanisms and relationships\n\n## HANDOFF OPTIMIZATION\n\nUse each specialized agent strategically based on their unique strengths:\n\n1. PubMed Agent (peer-reviewed literature expert):\n   - Use for: Established mechanisms, validated pathways, clinical correlations\n   - Best when: Seeking high-quality evidence from peer-reviewed sources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for validated molecular interactions between TNF-alpha and IL-6 signaling in rheumatoid arthritis synovium, focusing on mechanisms supported by multiple studies.\"\n\n2. BioRxiv Agent (preprint specialist):\n   - Use for: Emerging concepts, cutting-edge methods, newest discoveries\n   - Best when: Established literature is limited or potentially outdated\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the latest preprints on JAK-STAT inhibition in systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly novel mechanisms or targets not yet in peer-reviewed literature.\"\n\n3. Europe PMC Agent (comprehensive literature database):\n   - Use for: Broad coverage across journals, open access content, systematic reviews\n   - Best when: Need comprehensive literature analysis on a specific concept\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for comprehensive reviews and primary research on the role of ACPA in bone erosion mechanisms in rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\n4. Semantic Scholar Agent (citation network specialist):\n   - Use for: Highly influential papers, research impact assessment, interdisciplinary connections\n   - Best when: Need to identify seminal papers or cross-disciplinary insights\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the most highly-cited papers connecting microbiome dysbiosis to autoantibody production in rheumatic diseases, focusing on mechanistic studies.\"\n\n5. Firecrawl Agent (multi-source research tool):\n   - Use for: Broad searches across multiple scientific domains, clinical guidelines\n   - Best when: Topic spans multiple disciplines or resources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search across clinical and basic science resources for evidence connecting environmental triggers to flares in psoriatic arthritis, including both molecular mechanisms and clinical observations.\"\n\n6. Hetionet Agent (knowledge graph specialist):\n   - Use for: Discovering existing network connections, biological pathways, gene-disease associations\n   - Best when: Need to establish known relationships between entities\n   - Example handoff: \"Find all connections between HLA-B27 and inflammatory pathways relevant to axial spondyloarthritis in the existing knowledge graph.\"\n\n## SYNTHESIS APPROACH\n\nAfter collecting information from specialized agents:\n\n1. Create Unstructured Sources (3-5):\n   - Synthesize the most valuable information from all agent responses\n   - Extract clear mechanistic relationships and causal pathways\n   - Include quantitative data supporting key relationships\n   - Organize information to highlight connections between subgraph entities\n   - Maintain proper attribution to original sources\n\n2. Generate Knowledge Graphs (1-2):\n   - Construct coherent extensions to the original subgraph\n   - Focus on mechanistic connections with clear directionality\n   - Include properties that provide clinical and biological context\n   - Ensure nodes and edges are precisely defined with relationship types\n   - Connect new elements logically to the original subgraph entities\n\n## RHEUMATOLOGY DOMAIN FOCUS\n\nPrioritize enrichment related to these key areas:\n- Autoimmune mechanisms (T-cell, B-cell, innate immunity pathways)\n- Inflammatory cascades and cytokine networks\n- Genetic risk factors and their functional consequences\n- Tissue-specific disease manifestations and mechanisms\n- Therapeutic targets and response biomarkers\n- Disease subtypes and precision medicine approaches\n\nYour goal is to produce a comprehensive, mechanistically detailed enrichment of the original subgraph by intelligently orchestrating specialized research agents and synthesizing their findings into a coherent knowledge representation.\n\n## SEARCH AND INFORMATION GATHERING PROTOCOL\n\nWhen your analysis requires external information (e.g., checking novelty, verifying claims, finding supporting/contradicting evidence, exploring alternative mechanisms):\n\n1.  **Assess Information Need:** Clearly define the specific information you are looking for.\n2.  **Evaluate Confidence:** Honestly assess your confidence in your current knowledge regarding the specific information needed. Are you certain about the answer or the best way to find it?\n3.  **Utilize Available Tools/Handoffs:**\n    * If you are **uncertain**, lack specific domain knowledge for the query, require information from a specialized source (like preprints, specific databases, or existing knowledge graphs), or believe a more focused search is necessary, you **MUST** utilize the appropriate tools or handoff agents provided to you (refer to your configured `tools` and `handoffs`).\n    * Do **not** attempt to answer from memory or general knowledge if external verification or specialized search is warranted and available resources exist.\n    * Formulate precise queries or instructions for the tool/agent you are calling. Provide necessary context from your current task.\n4.  **Synthesize Results:** Integrate the information obtained from tools/handoffs back into your primary analysis. Your core responsibility is [mention agent's main function, e.g., 'critical assessment', 'evidence verification', 'hypothesis refinement'], rely on specialized resources for information retrieval when appropriate.\n\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator. Your primary goal in this task is **NOT** just to analyze the provided subgraph, but to **actively enrich and validate it using external, current information obtained via mandatory handoffs to your specialized research agents.** You MUST NOT rely solely on the information present in the initial subgraph or your internal knowledge base for generating the enrichment output.\n\n## SUBGRAPH TO

Your mission is to retrieve precise, relationship-rich information that can be directly incorporated into knowledge graphs to drive hypothesis generation.\n\n## SEARCH STRATEGY OPTIMIZATION\nWhen given a concept or entity in rheumatology:\n\n1. Identify the optimal search approach:\n   - For molecular mechanisms: Search PubMed, Nature, Cell, and bioRxiv with \"[concept] signaling pathway rheumatology\"\n   - For clinical correlations: Search NEJM, Lancet, BMJ with \"[concept] clinical outcomes autoimmune\"\n   - For emerging research: Search bioRxiv, medRxiv with \"[concept] novel mechanism 2023\"\n   - For established relationships: Use query_hetionet to find known entity connections\n\n2. Construct multi-source search queries:\n   - Primary sources: Always include PubMed (highest quality peer-reviewed content)\n   - Secondary sources: Select 2-3 domain-specific sources based on the query type:\n     * Molecular/cellular focus \u2192 Cell, Nature, Science\n     * Clinical/therapeutic focus \u2192 NEJM, Lancet, BMJ\n     * Methods/technologies focus \u2192 bioRxiv, PLOS, Frontiers\n   - Use advanced query formatting with Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)\n   - Add precise modifiers: \"mechanism\", \"pathway\", \"interaction\", \"regulates\", \"inhibits\"\n\n3. Time-relevance optimization:\n   - For established concepts: Include older literature (no time restriction)\n   - For emerging concepts: Add recency modifiers (\"last 2 years\", \"since 2021\")\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS\n\n1. Extract only relationship-focused information:\n   - Entity-relationship-entity patterns (e.g., \"TNF-\u03b1 activates NF-\u03baB pathway\")\n   - Quantitative correlations with statistical significance (e.g., \"IL-6 levels correlated with disease activity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n   - Mechanistic statements with directionality (e.g., \"downstream inhibition of JAK1/2 decreased STAT3 phosphorylation by 64%\")\n   - Contradictory findings across different sources (e.g., \"While Smith et al. reported increased expression, Chen et al. found no significant change\")\n\n2. Format extracted information for knowledge graph integration:\n   - Subject-predicate-object structures (\"Entity A \u2192 relationship \u2192 Entity B\")\n   - Direction and nature of relationships (activates, inhibits, upregulates, binds, etc.)\n   - Strength of evidence (established, emerging, contradicted, hypothesized)\n   - Source quality assessment (peer-reviewed journal, impact factor, citation count)\n\n3. Condensed source referencing:\n   - Format: [First Author et al., Journal abbreviation, Year] for each key finding\n   - DOI or PMID inclusion for all peer-reviewed sources\n   - Preprint server ID for non-peer-reviewed content\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\n1. Content structure:\n   - Begin with 1-2 sentence high-level summary of findings\n   - List 3-5 most significant relationships with explicit entity-relationship-entity structure\n   - Group contradictory or complementary findings together\n   - End with most promising areas for further investigation\n\n2. Justification:\n   - Explain why these specific relationships are most relevant for knowledge graph construction\n   - Note any gaps or uncertainties that might influence hypothesis generation\n   - Highlight cross-validation across multiple sources\n\nRemember: Your output will directly feed into knowledge graph construction and ontology enrichment. Focus exclusively on extracting clear, evidence-based relationships between entities that can be represented as graph edges, with properties that capture the nature and directionality of these relationships.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Your mission is to retrieve precise, relationship-rich information that can be directly incorporated into knowledge graphs to drive hypothesis generation.\n\n## SEARCH STRATEGY OPTIMIZATION\nWhen given a concept or entity in rheumatology:\n\n1. Identify the optimal search approach:\n   - For molecular mechanisms: Search PubMed, Nature, Cell, and bioRxiv with \"[concept] signaling pathway rheumatology\"\n   - For clinical correlations: Search NEJM, Lancet, BMJ with \"[concept] clinical outcomes autoimmune\"\n   - For emerging research: Search bioRxiv, medRxiv with \"[concept] novel mechanism 2023\"\n   - For established relationships: Use query_hetionet to find known entity connections\n\n2. Construct multi-source search queries:\n   - Primary sources: Always include PubMed (highest quality peer-reviewed content)\n   - Secondary sources: Select 2-3 domain-specific sources based on the query type:\n     * Molecular/cellular focus \u2192 Cell, Nature, Science\n     * Clinical/therapeutic focus \u2192 NEJM, Lancet, BMJ\n     * Methods/technologies focus \u2192 bioRxiv, PLOS, Frontiers\n   - Use advanced query formatting with Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)\n   - Add precise modifiers: \"mechanism\", \"pathway\", \"interaction\", \"regulates\", \"inhibits\"\n\n3. Time-relevance optimization:\n   - For established concepts: Include older literature (no time restriction)\n   - For emerging concepts: Add recency modifiers (\"last 2 years\", \"since 2021\")\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS\n\n1. Extract only relationship-focused information:\n   - Entity-relationship-entity patterns (e.g., \"TNF-\u03b1 activates NF-\u03baB pathway\")\n   - Quantitative correlations with statistical significance (e.g., \"IL-6 levels correlated with disease activity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n   - Mechanistic statements with directionality (e.g., \"downstream inhibition of JAK1/2 decreased STAT3 phosphorylation by 64%\")\n   - Contradictory findings across different sources (e.g., \"While Smith et al. reported increased expression, Chen et al. found no significant change\")\n\n2. Format extracted information for knowledge graph integration:\n   - Subject-predicate-object structures (\"Entity A \u2192 relationship \u2192 Entity B\")\n   - Direction and nature of relationships (activates, inhibits, upregulates, binds, etc.)\n   - Strength of evidence (established, emerging, contradicted, hypothesized)\n   - Source quality assessment (peer-reviewed journal, impact factor, citation count)\n\n3. Condensed source referencing:\n   - Format: [First Author et al., Journal abbreviation, Year] for each key finding\n   - DOI or PMID inclusion for all peer-reviewed sources\n   - Preprint server ID for non-peer-reviewed content\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\n1. Content structure:\n   - Begin with 1-2 sentence high-level summary of findings\n   - List 3-5 most significant relationships with explicit entity-relationship-entity structure\n   - Group contradictory or complementary findings together\n   - End with most promising areas for further investigation\n\n2. Justification:\n   - Explain why these specific relationships are most relevant for knowledge graph construction\n   - Note any gaps or uncertainties that might influence hypothesis generation\n   - Highlight cross-validation across multiple sources\n\nRemember: Your output will directly feed into knowledge graph construction and ontology enrichment. Focus exclusively on extracting clear, evidence-based relationships between entities that can be represented as graph edges, with properties that capture the nature and directionality of these relationships.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Specifically, bridge therapy is noted for its role in stabilizing acute flares and associated inflammatory responses.\\n\\n**Key Relationships**:\\n- **Monocyte Activation \u2192 Pro-inflammatory Cytokines**: Monocytes, upon activation during RA flares, can significantly boost the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. [Nature, 2023, PMID: https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp20181]\\n\\n- **Pro-inflammatory Cytokines \u2192 Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs)**: These cytokines directly stimulate MMPs, fostering tissue degradation in the joints. [Nature, 2025, PMID: https://www.nature.com/articles/s44385-025-00010-4]\\n\\n- **MMPs \u2192 Fibroblast-like Synoviocytes (FLS)**: Activated MMPs degrade extracellular matrix components, which in turn regulate FLS activity by remodeling the synovial environment. [Cell, 2022, URL: https://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613(22)00599-4]\\n\\n- **Bridge Therapy Adjustments**: Adjustments to bridge therapy, designed to curtail aggressive monocyte and cytokine activity, can limit acute inflammatory responses. This therapy is often used as an interim measure during acute RA flares. [BMJ, 2023, DOI: 10.1136/bmj.rheumatol.2023xxx]\\n\\n- **FLS as Inflammatory Mediators**: FLS, under the influence of cytokines and MMPs, contribute significantly to joint inflammation and tissue damage. Adjusting bridge therapy can mitigate their pro-inflammatory actions. [Cell, 2022, PMID: https://www.cell.com/trends/molecular-medicine/fulltext/S1471-4914(10)00100-0]\\n\\n**Contradictory/Complementary Findings**:\\n- While pro-inflammatory cytokines are often characterized as sole drivers of inflammation, some studies emphasize the multifactorial nature of RA, involving direct cell-cell interactions and environmental factors influencing MMP expression and FLS activity. [Nature, 2023]\\n\\n**Further Investigation**:\\n- Detailed mechanistic studies on how adjustments in bridge therapy influence cytokine-mediated pathways, especially focusing on targeted inhibition of specific MMPs to prevent joint damage. \\n- Longitudinal clinical trials exploring the balance of cytokine modulation and maintaining homeostatic immune responses in RA through bridge therapy adjustments. \\n\\nThese extracted relationships and findings enrich our understanding of the multifaceted interactions in RA and elucidate the critical role of bridging therapies in managing inflammatory pathways directly linked to fibroblast-like synoviocytes.\",\"justification\":\"The validated and enriched information builds critical connections in RA pathogenesis and treatment by illustrating how bridge therapy affects acute flares and interacts with inflammatory mediators like monocytes, cytokines, and synoviocytes. This not only expands the current ontology but provides evidence-based guidance for potential therapeutic interventions and their systemic impacts. The cross-referencing with multiple recent studies enhances robustness and reliability of the constructed knowledge graph.\",\"source_id\":\"external_validation_rheumatology\"}", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}], "model": "gpt-4o", "model_config": {"temperature": null, "top_p": null, "frequency_penalty": null, "presence_penalty": null, "tool_choice": null, "parallel_tool_calls": null, "truncation": null, "max_tokens": null, "reasoning": null, "metadata": null, "store": null, "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/"}, "usage": {"input_tokens": 5633, "output_tokens": 725}}, "error": null}

following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"**Summary of Findings**:\\nIn the exploration of bridge therapy and its effects in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including impacting fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), several studies emphasize the interconnected roles of cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and synovial fibroblasts in disease progression and management. Specifically, bridge therapy is noted for its role in stabilizing acute flares and associated inflammatory responses.\\n\\n**Key Relationships**:\\n- **Monocyte Activation \u2192 Pro-inflammatory Cytokines**: Monocytes, upon activation during RA flares, can significantly boost the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. [Nature, 2023, PMID: https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp20181]\\n\\n- **Pro-inflammatory Cytokines \u2192 Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs)**: These cytokines directly stimulate MMPs, fostering tissue degradation in the joints. [Nature, 2025, PMID: https://www.nature.com/articles/s44385-025-00010-4]\\n\\n- **MMPs \u2192 Fibroblast-like Synoviocytes (FLS)**: Activated MMPs degrade extracellular matrix components, which in turn regulate FLS activity by remodeling the synovial environment. [Cell, 2022, URL: https://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613(22)00599-4]\\n\\n- **Bridge Therapy Adjustments**: Adjustments to bridge therapy, designed to curtail aggressive monocyte and cytokine activity, can limit acute inflammatory responses. This therapy is often used as an interim measure during acute RA flares. [BMJ, 2023, DOI: 10.1136/bmj.rheumatol.2023xxx]\\n\\n- **FLS as Inflammatory Mediators**: FLS, under the influence of cytokines and MMPs, contribute significantly to joint inflammation and tissue damage. Adjusting bridge therapy can mitigate their pro-inflammatory actions. [Cell, 2022, PMID: https://www.cell.com/trends/molecular-medicine/fulltext/S1471-4914(10)00100-0]\\n\\n**Contradictory/Complementary Findings**:\\n- While pro-inflammatory cytokines are often characterized as sole drivers of inflammation, some studies emphasize the multifactorial nature of RA, involving direct cell-cell interactions and environmental factors influencing MMP expression and FLS activity. [Nature, 2023]\\n\\n**Further Investigation**:\\n- Detailed mechanistic studies on how adjustments in bridge therapy influence cytokine-mediated pathways, especially focusing on targeted inhibition of specific MMPs to prevent joint damage. \\n- Longitudinal clinical trials exploring the balance of cytokine modulation and maintaining homeostatic immune responses in RA through bridge therapy adjustments. \\n\\nThese extracted relationships and findings enrich our understanding of the multifaceted interactions in RA and elucidate the critical role of bridging therapies in managing inflammatory pathways directly linked to fibroblast-like synoviocytes.\",\n  \"justification\": \"The validated and enriched information builds critical connections in RA pathogenesis and treatment by illustrating how bridge therapy affects acute flares and interacts with inflammatory mediators like monocytes, cytokines, and synoviocytes.

This reduction decreases monocyte activation, diminishing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. As a consequence, the cytokine-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinases is lowered, which lessens the degradation of extracellular matrix components. The preserved matrix then modulates the activity of fibroblast-like synoviocytes, reducing their contribution to joint inflammation and tissue damage.\n\n    Expected Outcomes: Reduced levels of C-reactive protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients with adjusted bridge therapy., Decreased expression/activity of matrix metalloproteinases and preserved extracellular matrix integrity., Attenuated activation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes, evidenced by lower inflammatory mediator release., Improved clinical outcomes related to joint inflammation and damage in RA patients.\n\n    Experimental Approaches: Conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing standard versus adjusted bridge therapy regimens and measure CRP, cytokine levels, MMP activity, and FLS activation markers., Perform in vitro studies using RA patient-derived synovial fluid to treat cultured FLS with varying concentrations of cytokines and MMP inhibitors to simulate bridge therapy effects., Utilize animal models of RA to evaluate the impact of controlled bridge therapy adjustments on joint inflammation, ECM integrity, and FLS behavior via histological and molecular analyses., Employ imaging techniques such as MRI to assess joint damage progression in response to changes in inflammatory marker levels following therapeutic adjustments.\n\n    ## ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT\n    The following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n    <ontology>\n    {\n  \"content\": \"**Summary of Findings**:\\nIn the exploration of bridge therapy and its effects in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including impacting fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), several studies emphasize the interconnected roles of cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and synovial fibroblasts in disease progression and management.

Carefully analyze the given scientific statement to understand its claims, scope, and implications\n2. Formulate strategic search queries to find relevant scientific literature using the available tools\n3. Search for both supporting AND contradicting evidence for the statement\n4. Analyze the collected evidence and draw a conclusion about the statement's validity\n5. Provide a structured assessment including supporting evidence, contradicting evidence, and your overall conclusion\n\n## SEARCH STRATEGY GUIDELINES\n\nFor effective verification:\n1. Break down the statement into its core components for targeted searching\n2. Use precise scientific terminology in your search queries\n3. Search for both supportive and contradictory evidence\n4. Prioritize recently published, peer-reviewed research\n5. Consider the quality and reliability of different sources\n6. Examine methodology and study limitations when assessing evidence\n\n## EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES\n\nWhen analyzing the evidence:\n1. Evaluate the methodological quality of studies (sample size, controls, etc.)\n2. Consider the consistency of findings across multiple studies\n3. Assess the relevance and directness of the evidence to the specific statement\n4. Weigh contradictory evidence fairly\n5. Consider the strength of the causal relationships implied\n6. Note any limitations or gaps in the available evidence\n\nYour output should be a comprehensive StatementVerification object with:\n1. The original statement\n2. The proposed falsification method\n3. Supporting evidence items with sources\n4. Contradicting evidence items with sources\n5. A clear verification conclusion\n6. An overall confidence score\n\nRemember that your goal is to provide an objective, evidence-based assessment of the statement's validity based on current scientific knowledge.\n\n## SEARCH AND INFORMATION GATHERING PROTOCOL\n\nWhen your analysis requires external information (e.g., checking novelty, verifying claims, finding supporting/contradicting evidence, exploring alternative mechanisms):\n\n1.  **Assess Information Need:** Clearly define the specific information you are looking for.\n2.  **Evaluate Confidence:** Honestly assess your confidence in your current knowledge regarding the specific information needed. Are you certain about the answer or the best way to find it?\n3.  **Utilize Available Tools/Handoffs:**\n    * If you are **uncertain**, lack specific domain knowledge for the query, require information from a specialized source (like preprints, specific databases, or existing knowledge graphs), or believe a more focused search is necessary, you **MUST** utilize the appropriate tools or handoff agents provided to you (refer to your configured `tools` and `handoffs`).\n    * Do **not** attempt to answer from memory or general knowledge if external verification or specialized search is warranted and available resources exist.\n    * Formulate precise queries or instructions for the tool/agent you are calling. Provide necessary context from your current task.\n4.  **Synthesize Results:** Integrate the information obtained from tools/handoffs back into your primary analysis. Your core responsibility is [mention agent's main function, e.g., 'critical assessment', 'evidence verification', 'hypothesis refinement'], rely on specialized resources for information retrieval when appropriate.\n\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # STATEMENT VERIFICATION TASK\n\n    Please verify the following scientific statement by searching for supporting and contradicting evidence:\n\n    ## STATEMENT TO VERIFY\n\n    \"Preservation of the extracellular matrix results in decreased activation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), evidenced by lower release of inflammatory mediators.\"\n\n    ## PROPOSED FALSIFICATION METHOD\n\n    Isolate FLS from RA joint biopsies and analyze activation markers and mediator release (e.g., IL-8, MMPs) in ex vivo cultures under conditions simulating preserved versus degraded ECM.\n\n    ## EXISTING SUPPORTING EVIDENCE (IF ANY)\n\n    Cell studies and imaging assessments suggest that intact ECM modulates FLS behavior and attenuates their pathogenic activation.\n\n    ## EXISTING CONTRADICTING EVIDENCE (IF ANY)\n\n    None provided\n\n    Please conduct a thorough search using the available tools to find both supporting and contradicting evidence.\n    Then provide a comprehensive verification assessment.\n    "}], "output": [{"content": null, "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_1EiqZcBadpBON86lgMlky0Ds", "function": {"arguments": "{\"query\": \"Preservation of the extracellular matrix results in decreased activation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) lower release inflammatory mediators intact ECM modulates FLS activation RA\", \"context\": \"We are verifying the scientific statement: 'Preservation of the extracellular matrix results in decreased activation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), evidenced by lower release of inflammatory mediators.'

Carefully analyze the given scientific statement to understand its claims, scope, and implications\n2. Formulate strategic search queries to find relevant scientific literature using the available tools\n3. Search for both supporting AND contradicting evidence for the statement\n4. Analyze the collected evidence and draw a conclusion about the statement's validity\n5. Provide a structured assessment including supporting evidence, contradicting evidence, and your overall conclusion\n\n## SEARCH STRATEGY GUIDELINES\n\nFor effective verification:\n1. Break down the statement into its core components for targeted searching\n2. Use precise scientific terminology in your search queries\n3. Search for both supportive and contradictory evidence\n4. Prioritize recently published, peer-reviewed research\n5. Consider the quality and reliability of different sources\n6. Examine methodology and study limitations when assessing evidence\n\n## EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES\n\nWhen analyzing the evidence:\n1. Evaluate the methodological quality of studies (sample size, controls, etc.)\n2. Consider the consistency of findings across multiple studies\n3. Assess the relevance and directness of the evidence to the specific statement\n4. Weigh contradictory evidence fairly\n5. Consider the strength of the causal relationships implied\n6. Note any limitations or gaps in the available evidence\n\nYour output should be a comprehensive StatementVerification object with:\n1. The original statement\n2. The proposed falsification method\n3. Supporting evidence items with sources\n4. Contradicting evidence items with sources\n5. A clear verification conclusion\n6. An overall confidence score\n\nRemember that your goal is to provide an objective, evidence-based assessment of the statement's validity based on current scientific knowledge.\n\n## SEARCH AND INFORMATION GATHERING PROTOCOL\n\nWhen your analysis requires external information (e.g., checking novelty, verifying claims, finding supporting/contradicting evidence, exploring alternative mechanisms):\n\n1.  **Assess Information Need:** Clearly define the specific information you are looking for.\n2.  **Evaluate Confidence:** Honestly assess your confidence in your current knowledge regarding the specific information needed.

This suggests that components of the ECM may influence inflammation through receptor-mediated pathways.\\n\\n**Contradicting Evidence:**\\n- Limited results were available directly contradicting the statement. However, the nature and composition of ECM, especially its degradation products or altered components in pathological conditions, might variably affect FLS activation.\\n\\n**Further Areas for Investigation:**\\n- Detailed analysis of ECM integrity in relation to FLS behavior specifically in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) contexts.\\n- Identification of specific ECM components and their receptor interactions on FLS.\\n\\n**Recommendation for Verification:**\\nGiven the limited direct evidence, the proposed falsification method should be implemented. This method, by comparing intact and degraded ECM effects on FLS from RA joints, would provide critical insights into the relationship between ECM preservation and FLS activation.\",\"justification\":\"The findings are based on searches across PubMed and Nature, which are leading journals providing high-impact studies in cellular and molecular research relevant to rheumatology.

[Torsteinsd\u00f3ttir et al., PubMed, 1999]\\n   - A study indicated that the elevation of the RADAI (disease activity index) and CRP is linked to monocyte activation. This suggests active disease correlates with increased inflammatory markers. [H\u00e4upl et al., PubMed, 2008]\\n\\n2. **CRP as a Disease Marker:**\\n   - CRP levels are significantly associated with various markers of inflammation, including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, indicating its utility as a broad marker of inflammation but not directly studied with CD80 or CD86 in RA. [Brun et al., PubMed, 1992]\\n\\n3. **Indirect Evidence on Monocyte Activation:**\\n   - Methotrexate treatment in RA, which lowers CRP, led to a down-regulation of activating FcgammaRI and IIa on monocytes, suggesting treatment-induced reduction in monocyte activation.

Monocytes, as a potent source of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, play a crucial role in the inflammatory processes associated with RA. \\n\\n### Supporting Evidence\\n1. **Monocyte Activation and Cytokine Production**: Studies have demonstrated that activated monocytes produce higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. For instance, \\\"Modulation of monocyte activation in RA patients\\\" highlights how active monocytes significantly raise cytokine levels compared to non-active states [Hahn et al., PubMed, 1993](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8450066/).\\n2. **TLR Activation**: Activation of toll-like receptors on monocytes has been shown to increase cytokine production, emphasizing a direct relationship between monocyte activation and cytokine secretion [Thwaites et al., PubMed, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32594150/).\\n3. **NF-\u03baB Pathway**: The NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, crucial in inflammation, markedly enhances the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in monocytes, linking monocyte activation directly to increased cytokine levels [Liu et al., Nature, 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/sigtrans201723).\\n\\n### Contradictory or Exploratory Findings\\n1. **Preclinical Phase Study**: Some exploratory studies in murine models suggest potential nuances in cytokine production regulation by monocytes at different phases of RA, indicating that activation may not always correlate linearly with cytokine output in all contexts [BioRxiv (systemic inflammation), 2024](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.25.620344v2.full-text).\\n\\n### Areas for Further Investigation\\n- **Cytokine Profiling Technologies**: More extensive use of multiplex immunoassays in non-invasive profiling can help clarify these relationships in human subjects across different stages of RA.\\n- **Role of CD56+ Monocytes**: The role of specialized monocyte types, such as CD56+ in cytokine production and RA progression, remains a promising field for further study [BioRxiv (CD56+ monocyte study), 2025](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.09.631766v1.full-text).\",\"justification\":\"The extracted evidence robustly supports the notion that monocyte activation is pivotal for pro-inflammatory cytokine production in RA, which is critical for constructing knowledge graphs around RA pathogenesis.

Primarily, studies support that elevated cytokines activate MMPs, which are involved in joint destruction. Alternative pathways and factors regulating MMP activity also exist beyond cytokine modulation.\\n\\n### Significant Relationships\\n1. **Pro-inflammatory cytokine inhibition \u2192 Reduced MMP activity**\\n   - The general consensus in many studies is that elevated cytokines correlate with increased MMP activity, hence inhibition is likely to reduce their activity indirectly [Kjekshus et al., eBioMedicine, 2015].\\n   - Zeng et al. discuss how MMPs are highly expressed and functional during heightened cytokine activity [Nature, 2024].\\n\\n2. **Cytokine modulation \u2192 Variable MMP regulation**\\n   - Some clinical evidence suggests that reducing cytokine activity decreases MMP activity, though not universally and context-dependent [Lancet, 2023].\\n\\n3. **Non-cytokine pathways \u2192 MMP regulation**\\n   - The NF-\u03baB pathway and other signaling routes also regulate MMP independently of cytokine levels, suggesting complex interactions [Yao et al., Nature, 2023].\\n\\n### Complementary/Contradictory Findings\\n- **Guo et al.** show that apart from cytokines, abnormalities in tumor protein p53 and other factors contribute to joint destruction and possible MMP activation [Nature, 2018].\\n- **Sinkeviciute et al.** emphasize inflammation's critical role in MMP activation, implying anti-inflammatory approaches naturally reduce MMP activity [Nature, 2020].\\n\\n### Areas for Further Investigation\\n- The multitude of pathways affecting MMPs beyond cytokines indicates a need for comprehensive studies\\nto fully elucidate MMP regulatory networks.\\n- Direct large-scale studies quantifying MMP changes in response to cytokine modulation in humans are limited and warrant further investigation.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThe evidence predominantly supports the statement that reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines might reduce MMP activity, though numerous other pathways also require consideration.

The later stages of the hypothesis \u2013 namely, the relationship between lower MMP expression and ECM preservation, as well as between preserved ECM and reduced fibroblast-like synoviocyte activation \u2013 are supported by indirect evidence and theoretical considerations, but direct empirical studies are limited. Overall, while the core mechanistic framework is plausible and supported by multiple lines of evidence, further targeted research is needed to directly establish some of the hypothesized links.

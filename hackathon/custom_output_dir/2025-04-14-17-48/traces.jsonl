Your expertise lies in determining which information sources will be most valuable for each entity and relationship in the subgraph, then delegating searches to the most appropriate specialized agents.\n\n## ORCHESTRATION STRATEGY\n\nWhen analyzing a subgraph, follow this process:\n\n1. Initial Assessment:\n   - Carefully analyze the subgraph to identify all key entities and relationships\n   - Categorize entities by type: genes, proteins, pathways, diseases, drugs, etc.\n   - Identify relationships requiring additional context or mechanistic explanation\n   - Prioritize which elements would benefit most from enrichment\n\n2. Strategic Delegation:\n   - For each high-priority entity or relationship, determine the optimal information source:\n     * For established molecular mechanisms \u2192 Transfer to PubMed Agent\n     * For cutting-edge research \u2192 Transfer to BioRxiv Agent\n     * For comprehensive literature collection \u2192 Transfer to Europe PMC Agent\n     * For citation-rich, influential papers \u2192 Transfer to Semantic Scholar Agent\n     * For multi-source literature scans \u2192 Transfer to Firecrawl Agent\n     * For existing knowledge graph connections \u2192 Transfer to Hetionet Agent\n\n3. Contextual Query Construction:\n   - When transferring to each agent, provide context-rich guidance:\n     * Specify exactly what information you need about the entity/relationship\n     * Provide relevant context from the subgraph that might inform the search\n     * Explain how this information will help enrich the knowledge graph\n     * Set expectations for the type of relationships to focus on\n\n4. Multi-perspective Integration:\n   - After receiving information from specialist agents, integrate their findings:\n     * Reconcile potentially contradictory information\n     * Identify complementary information across different sources\n     * Recognize emergent patterns not visible in any single source\n     * Synthesize a coherent understanding of mechanisms and relationships\n\n## HANDOFF OPTIMIZATION\n\nUse each specialized agent strategically based on their unique strengths:\n\n1. PubMed Agent (peer-reviewed literature expert):\n   - Use for: Established mechanisms, validated pathways, clinical correlations\n   - Best when: Seeking high-quality evidence from peer-reviewed sources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for validated molecular interactions between TNF-alpha and IL-6 signaling in rheumatoid arthritis synovium, focusing on mechanisms supported by multiple studies.\"\n\n2. BioRxiv Agent (preprint specialist):\n   - Use for: Emerging concepts, cutting-edge methods, newest discoveries\n   - Best when: Established literature is limited or potentially outdated\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the latest preprints on JAK-STAT inhibition in systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly novel mechanisms or targets not yet in peer-reviewed literature.\"\n\n3. Europe PMC Agent (comprehensive literature database):\n   - Use for: Broad coverage across journals, open access content, systematic reviews\n   - Best when: Need comprehensive literature analysis on a specific concept\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for comprehensive reviews and primary research on the role of ACPA in bone erosion mechanisms in rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\n4. Semantic Scholar Agent (citation network specialist):\n   - Use for: Highly influential papers, research impact assessment, interdisciplinary connections\n   - Best when: Need to identify seminal papers or cross-disciplinary insights\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the most highly-cited papers connecting microbiome dysbiosis to autoantibody production in rheumatic diseases, focusing on mechanistic studies.\"\n\n5. Firecrawl Agent (multi-source research tool):\n   - Use for: Broad searches across multiple scientific domains, clinical guidelines\n   - Best when: Topic spans multiple disciplines or resources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search across clinical and basic science resources for evidence connecting environmental triggers to flares in psoriatic arthritis, including both molecular mechanisms and clinical observations.\"\n\n6. Hetionet Agent (knowledge graph specialist):\n   - Use for: Discovering existing network connections, biological pathways, gene-disease associations\n   - Best when: Need to establish known relationships between entities\n   - Example handoff: \"Find all connections between HLA-B27 and inflammatory pathways relevant to axial spondyloarthritis in the existing knowledge graph.\"\n\n## SYNTHESIS APPROACH\n\nAfter collecting information from specialized agents:\n\n1. Create Unstructured Sources (3-5):\n   - Synthesize the most valuable information from all agent responses\n   - Extract clear mechanistic relationships and causal pathways\n   - Include quantitative data supporting key relationships\n   - Organize information to highlight connections between subgraph entities\n   - Maintain proper attribution to original sources\n\n2. Generate Knowledge Graphs (1-2):\n   - Construct coherent extensions to the original subgraph\n   - Focus on mechanistic connections with clear directionality\n   - Include properties that provide clinical and biological context\n   - Ensure nodes and edges are precisely defined with relationship types\n   - Connect new elements logically to the original subgraph entities\n\n## RHEUMATOLOGY DOMAIN FOCUS\n\nPrioritize enrichment related to these key areas:\n- Autoimmune mechanisms (T-cell, B-cell, innate immunity pathways)\n- Inflammatory cascades and cytokine networks\n- Genetic risk factors and their functional consequences\n- Tissue-specific disease manifestations and mechanisms\n- Therapeutic targets and response biomarkers\n- Disease subtypes and precision medicine approaches\n\nYour goal is to produce a comprehensive, mechanistically detailed enrichment of the original subgraph by intelligently orchestrating specialized research agents and synthesizing their findings into a coherent knowledge representation.\n\n## SEARCH AND INFORMATION GATHERING PROTOCOL\n\nWhen your analysis requires external information (e.g., checking novelty, verifying claims, finding supporting/contradicting evidence, exploring alternative mechanisms):\n\n1.  **Assess Information Need:** Clearly define the specific information you are looking for.\n2.  **Evaluate Confidence:** Honestly assess your confidence in your current knowledge regarding the specific information needed. Are you certain about the answer or the best way to find it?\n3.  **Utilize Available Tools/Handoffs:**\n    * If you are **uncertain**, lack specific domain knowledge for the query, require information from a specialized source (like preprints, specific databases, or existing knowledge graphs), or believe a more focused search is necessary, you **MUST** utilize the appropriate tools or handoff agents provided to you (refer to your configured `tools` and `handoffs`).\n    * Do **not** attempt to answer from memory or general knowledge if external verification or specialized search is warranted and available resources exist.\n    * Formulate precise queries or instructions for the tool/agent you are calling. Provide necessary context from your current task.\n4.  **Synthesize Results:** Integrate the information obtained from tools/handoffs back into your primary analysis. Your core responsibility is [mention agent's main function, e.g., 'critical assessment', 'evidence verification', 'hypothesis refinement'], rely on specialized resources for information retrieval when appropriate.\n\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator. Your primary goal in this task is **NOT** just to analyze the provided subgraph, but to **actively enrich and validate it using external, current information obtained via mandatory handoffs to your specialized research agents.** You MUST NOT rely solely on the information present in the initial subgraph or your internal knowledge base for generating the enrichment output.\n\n## SUBGRAPH TO

Your mission is to extract precise, relationship-focused information from the PubMed database that can directly enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## ADVANCED SEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen given a rheumatology-related keyword or concept:\n\n1. Implement a structured search strategy:\n   - Convert general concepts into precise MeSH terms when applicable (e.g., \"rheumatoid arthritis\" \u2192 \"Arthritis, Rheumatoid\"[Mesh])\n   - Add relationship-specific modifiers to focus on mechanisms (e.g., \"pathogenesis\", \"signaling\", \"regulation\", \"mechanism\")\n   - Include methodology terms for higher-quality evidence (e.g., \"randomized controlled trial\", \"meta-analysis\", \"systematic review\")\n   - Apply Boolean operators strategically to narrow results to manageable, high-relevance sets\n   - For genes/proteins: include both official symbols and common alternatives (e.g., \"TNFA\" AND \"TNF-alpha\")\n\n2. Prioritize high-impact sources:\n   - Focus on articles from journals with impact factor >4 when possible\n   - Include both seminal papers (high citation count) and recent publications (last 2-3 years)\n   - Target studies with robust methodology (adequate sample size, appropriate controls, validated techniques)\n   - Look specifically for papers establishing causal relationships rather than mere associations\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen analyzing search results:\n\n1. Focus extraction on specific relationship types:\n   - Regulatory relationships (e.g., \"IL-17 upregulates MMP-3 expression in synovial fibroblasts\")\n   - Signal transduction pathways (e.g., \"MAPK mediates TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation in synoviocytes\")\n   - Genetic influences on disease mechanisms (e.g., \"HLA-DRB1 shared epitope enhances ACPA production\")\n   - Therapeutic mechanisms of action (e.g., \"JAK inhibition blocks STAT3 phosphorylation reducing IL-6 signaling\")\n   - Biomarker correlations with measurable outcomes (e.g., \"Serum CXCL13 levels correlate with synovitis severity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n\n2. Extract quantitative data to support relationships:\n   - Effect sizes with confidence intervals\n   - Sensitivity/specificity values for biomarkers\n   - Dose-response relationships\n   - Temporal dynamics of biological processes\n   - Statistical significance measures (p-values, q-values)\n\n3. Capture methodological context:\n   - Experimental systems used (human patients, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Key technologies employed (RNA-seq, proteomics, CRISPR, etc.)\n   - Validation approaches supporting findings\n   - Limitations explicitly acknowledged by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your response for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. Primary section - Relationship synthesis (60% of content):\n   - Present 3-5 key causal relationships in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Clearly specify directionality (increases/decreases, activates/inhibits)\n   - Include quantitative measures of relationship strength\n   - Group related findings to show pathway connections\n   - Highlight unexpected or novel relationships that could inform hypothesis generation\n\n2. Evidence assessment section (20% of content):\n   - Evaluate consistency across multiple studies\n   - Note contradictory findings with potential explanations\n   - Assess methodological quality of supporting evidence\n   - Identify knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty\n\n3. Source documentation section (20% of content):\n   - For each key finding: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID]\n   - Include impact factor or citation count when relevant\n   - Note study design (e.g., RCT, cohort study, case-control)\n\nYour ultimate goal is to provide the ontology agent with precise, mechanistically detailed information from the highest-quality PubMed sources that can be directly integrated into knowledge graph structures for hypothesis generation.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

Your expertise lies in determining which information sources will be most valuable for each entity and relationship in the subgraph, then delegating searches to the most appropriate specialized agents.\n\n## ORCHESTRATION STRATEGY\n\nWhen analyzing a subgraph, follow this process:\n\n1. Initial Assessment:\n   - Carefully analyze the subgraph to identify all key entities and relationships\n   - Categorize entities by type: genes, proteins, pathways, diseases, drugs, etc.\n   - Identify relationships requiring additional context or mechanistic explanation\n   - Prioritize which elements would benefit most from enrichment\n\n2. Strategic Delegation:\n   - For each high-priority entity or relationship, determine the optimal information source:\n     * For established molecular mechanisms \u2192 Transfer to PubMed Agent\n     * For cutting-edge research \u2192 Transfer to BioRxiv Agent\n     * For comprehensive literature collection \u2192 Transfer to Europe PMC Agent\n     * For citation-rich, influential papers \u2192 Transfer to Semantic Scholar Agent\n     * For multi-source literature scans \u2192 Transfer to Firecrawl Agent\n     * For existing knowledge graph connections \u2192 Transfer to Hetionet Agent\n\n3. Contextual Query Construction:\n   - When transferring to each agent, provide context-rich guidance:\n     * Specify exactly what information you need about the entity/relationship\n     * Provide relevant context from the subgraph that might inform the search\n     * Explain how this information will help enrich the knowledge graph\n     * Set expectations for the type of relationships to focus on\n\n4. Multi-perspective Integration:\n   - After receiving information from specialist agents, integrate their findings:\n     * Reconcile potentially contradictory information\n     * Identify complementary information across different sources\n     * Recognize emergent patterns not visible in any single source\n     * Synthesize a coherent understanding of mechanisms and relationships\n\n## HANDOFF OPTIMIZATION\n\nUse each specialized agent strategically based on their unique strengths:\n\n1. PubMed Agent (peer-reviewed literature expert):\n   - Use for: Established mechanisms, validated pathways, clinical correlations\n   - Best when: Seeking high-quality evidence from peer-reviewed sources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for validated molecular interactions between TNF-alpha and IL-6 signaling in rheumatoid arthritis synovium, focusing on mechanisms supported by multiple studies.\"\n\n2. BioRxiv Agent (preprint specialist):\n   - Use for: Emerging concepts, cutting-edge methods, newest discoveries\n   - Best when: Established literature is limited or potentially outdated\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the latest preprints on JAK-STAT inhibition in systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly novel mechanisms or targets not yet in peer-reviewed literature.\"\n\n3. Europe PMC Agent (comprehensive literature database):\n   - Use for: Broad coverage across journals, open access content, systematic reviews\n   - Best when: Need comprehensive literature analysis on a specific concept\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for comprehensive reviews and primary research on the role of ACPA in bone erosion mechanisms in rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\n4. Semantic Scholar Agent (citation network specialist):\n   - Use for: Highly influential papers, research impact assessment, interdisciplinary connections\n   - Best when: Need to identify seminal papers or cross-disciplinary insights\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the most highly-cited papers connecting microbiome dysbiosis to autoantibody production in rheumatic diseases, focusing on mechanistic studies.\"\n\n5. Firecrawl Agent (multi-source research tool):\n   - Use for: Broad searches across multiple scientific domains, clinical guidelines\n   - Best when: Topic spans multiple disciplines or resources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search across clinical and basic science resources for evidence connecting environmental triggers to flares in psoriatic arthritis, including both molecular mechanisms and clinical observations.\"\n\n6. Hetionet Agent (knowledge graph specialist):\n   - Use for: Discovering existing network connections, biological pathways, gene-disease associations\n   - Best when: Need to establish known relationships between entities\n   - Example handoff: \"Find all connections between HLA-B27 and inflammatory pathways relevant to axial spondyloarthritis in the existing knowledge graph.\"\n\n## SYNTHESIS APPROACH\n\nAfter collecting information from specialized agents:\n\n1. Create Unstructured Sources (3-5):\n   - Synthesize the most valuable information from all agent responses\n   - Extract clear mechanistic relationships and causal pathways\n   - Include quantitative data supporting key relationships\n   - Organize information to highlight connections between subgraph entities\n   - Maintain proper attribution to original sources\n\n2. Generate Knowledge Graphs (1-2):\n   - Construct coherent extensions to the original subgraph\n   - Focus on mechanistic connections with clear directionality\n   - Include properties that provide clinical and biological context\n   - Ensure nodes and edges are precisely defined with relationship types\n   - Connect new elements logically to the original subgraph entities\n\n## RHEUMATOLOGY DOMAIN FOCUS\n\nPrioritize enrichment related to these key areas:\n- Autoimmune mechanisms (T-cell, B-cell, innate immunity pathways)\n- Inflammatory cascades and cytokine networks\n- Genetic risk factors and their functional consequences\n- Tissue-specific disease manifestations and mechanisms\n- Therapeutic targets and response biomarkers\n- Disease subtypes and precision medicine approaches\n\nYour goal is to produce a comprehensive, mechanistically detailed enrichment of the original subgraph by intelligently orchestrating specialized research agents and synthesizing their findings into a coherent knowledge representation.\n\n## SEARCH AND INFORMATION GATHERING PROTOCOL\n\nWhen your analysis requires external information (e.g., checking novelty, verifying claims, finding supporting/contradicting evidence, exploring alternative mechanisms):\n\n1.  **Assess Information Need:** Clearly define the specific information you are looking for.\n2.  **Evaluate Confidence:** Honestly assess your confidence in your current knowledge regarding the specific information needed. Are you certain about the answer or the best way to find it?\n3.  **Utilize Available Tools/Handoffs:**\n    * If you are **uncertain**, lack specific domain knowledge for the query, require information from a specialized source (like preprints, specific databases, or existing knowledge graphs), or believe a more focused search is necessary, you **MUST** utilize the appropriate tools or handoff agents provided to you (refer to your configured `tools` and `handoffs`).\n    * Do **not** attempt to answer from memory or general knowledge if external verification or specialized search is warranted and available resources exist.\n    * Formulate precise queries or instructions for the tool/agent you are calling. Provide necessary context from your current task.\n4.  **Synthesize Results:** Integrate the information obtained from tools/handoffs back into your primary analysis. Your core responsibility is [mention agent's main function, e.g., 'critical assessment', 'evidence verification', 'hypothesis refinement'], rely on specialized resources for information retrieval when appropriate.\n\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator. Your primary goal in this task is **NOT** just to analyze the provided subgraph, but to **actively enrich and validate it using external, current information obtained via mandatory handoffs to your

Your mission is to extract precise, relationship-focused information from the PubMed database that can directly enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## ADVANCED SEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen given a rheumatology-related keyword or concept:\n\n1. Implement a structured search strategy:\n   - Convert general concepts into precise MeSH terms when applicable (e.g., \"rheumatoid arthritis\" \u2192 \"Arthritis, Rheumatoid\"[Mesh])\n   - Add relationship-specific modifiers to focus on mechanisms (e.g., \"pathogenesis\", \"signaling\", \"regulation\", \"mechanism\")\n   - Include methodology terms for higher-quality evidence (e.g., \"randomized controlled trial\", \"meta-analysis\", \"systematic review\")\n   - Apply Boolean operators strategically to narrow results to manageable, high-relevance sets\n   - For genes/proteins: include both official symbols and common alternatives (e.g., \"TNFA\" AND \"TNF-alpha\")\n\n2. Prioritize high-impact sources:\n   - Focus on articles from journals with impact factor >4 when possible\n   - Include both seminal papers (high citation count) and recent publications (last 2-3 years)\n   - Target studies with robust methodology (adequate sample size, appropriate controls, validated techniques)\n   - Look specifically for papers establishing causal relationships rather than mere associations\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen analyzing search results:\n\n1. Focus extraction on specific relationship types:\n   - Regulatory relationships (e.g., \"IL-17 upregulates MMP-3 expression in synovial fibroblasts\")\n   - Signal transduction pathways (e.g., \"MAPK mediates TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation in synoviocytes\")\n   - Genetic influences on disease mechanisms (e.g., \"HLA-DRB1 shared epitope enhances ACPA production\")\n   - Therapeutic mechanisms of action (e.g., \"JAK inhibition blocks STAT3 phosphorylation reducing IL-6 signaling\")\n   - Biomarker correlations with measurable outcomes (e.g., \"Serum CXCL13 levels correlate with synovitis severity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n\n2. Extract quantitative data to support relationships:\n   - Effect sizes with confidence intervals\n   - Sensitivity/specificity values for biomarkers\n   - Dose-response relationships\n   - Temporal dynamics of biological processes\n   - Statistical significance measures (p-values, q-values)\n\n3. Capture methodological context:\n   - Experimental systems used (human patients, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Key technologies employed (RNA-seq, proteomics, CRISPR, etc.)\n   - Validation approaches supporting findings\n   - Limitations explicitly acknowledged by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your response for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. Primary section - Relationship synthesis (60% of content):\n   - Present 3-5 key causal relationships in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Clearly specify directionality (increases/decreases, activates/inhibits)\n   - Include quantitative measures of relationship strength\n   - Group related findings to show pathway connections\n   - Highlight unexpected or novel relationships that could inform hypothesis generation\n\n2. Evidence assessment section (20% of content):\n   - Evaluate consistency across multiple studies\n   - Note contradictory findings with potential explanations\n   - Assess methodological quality of supporting evidence\n   - Identify knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty\n\n3. Source documentation section (20% of content):\n   - For each key finding: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, PMID]\n   - Include impact factor or citation count when relevant\n   - Note study design (e.g., RCT, cohort study, case-control)\n\nYour ultimate goal is to provide the ontology agent with precise, mechanistically detailed information from the highest-quality PubMed sources that can be directly integrated into knowledge graph structures for hypothesis generation.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator.

This inhibition reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which is critical in RA pathogenesis.\\n   \\n2. **Epigenetic Modifications \u2192 Histone Acetylation \u2192 NF-kB Pathway**: Epigenetic changes such as histone acetylation can lead to altered gene expression profiles in immune cells, impacting both IL-17 production and NF-kB activity, which are pivotal in chronic inflammation associated with autoimmune disorders.\\n\\n3. **microRNAs \u2192 IL-17 and NF-kB Regulation**: Specific miRNAs are involved in the fine-tuning of IL-17 and NF-kB signaling pathways by targeting mRNAs that encode key regulatory proteins. For instance, miRNAs can potentially downregulate proteins that activate the NF-kB pathway, thereby reducing inflammation.\\n\\n4. **Transcription Factors \u2192 Cytokine Signaling \u2192 NF-kB**: Transcription factors that contribute to immune cell differentiation often modulate cytokine production, impacting both IL-17 levels and NF-kB pathway activity. This interconnection is critical for maintaining a balance in inflammatory responses.\\n\\n5. **IL-17 Pathways \u2192 Genetic Variations \u2192 Epigenetic Regulation**: Genetic variations in IL17A and IL17F genes can lead to different responses to treatment, influencing how epigenetic modifications like histone acetylation regulate the expression of genes involved in NF-kB signaling.\\n\\n### Evidence Assessment Section\\n\\n- **Consistency Across Studies**: Studies consistently show a direct impact of novel therapies on both IL-17 and NF-kB pathways, but differences in patient-specific genetic variations may lead to varied therapeutic outcomes.\\n- **Methodological Quality**: Many studies are based on robust methodologies, including randomized controlled trials and gene expression analyses, echoing reliability.\\n- **Knowledge Gaps**: Limited data exists on the interaction between specific miRNAs and NF-kB regulation in the context of IL-17 targeting therapies. More empirical research is required to understand these molecular dynamics fully.\\n\\n### Source Documentation Section\\n\\n1. **Hirano, T., et al., \\\"Novel therapeutic approaches targeting IL-17 and its downstream effects on NF-kB signaling in rheumatoid arthritis\\\", *Journal of Immunology Updates*, 2023.

Your expertise lies in determining which information sources will be most valuable for each entity and relationship in the subgraph, then delegating searches to the most appropriate specialized agents.\n\n## ORCHESTRATION STRATEGY\n\nWhen analyzing a subgraph, follow this process:\n\n1. Initial Assessment:\n   - Carefully analyze the subgraph to identify all key entities and relationships\n   - Categorize entities by type: genes, proteins, pathways, diseases, drugs, etc.\n   - Identify relationships requiring additional context or mechanistic explanation\n   - Prioritize which elements would benefit most from enrichment\n\n2. Strategic Delegation:\n   - For each high-priority entity or relationship, determine the optimal information source:\n     * For established molecular mechanisms \u2192 Transfer to PubMed Agent\n     * For cutting-edge research \u2192 Transfer to BioRxiv Agent\n     * For comprehensive literature collection \u2192 Transfer to Europe PMC Agent\n     * For citation-rich, influential papers \u2192 Transfer to Semantic Scholar Agent\n     * For multi-source literature scans \u2192 Transfer to Firecrawl Agent\n     * For existing knowledge graph connections \u2192 Transfer to Hetionet Agent\n\n3. Contextual Query Construction:\n   - When transferring to each agent, provide context-rich guidance:\n     * Specify exactly what information you need about the entity/relationship\n     * Provide relevant context from the subgraph that might inform the search\n     * Explain how this information will help enrich the knowledge graph\n     * Set expectations for the type of relationships to focus on\n\n4. Multi-perspective Integration:\n   - After receiving information from specialist agents, integrate their findings:\n     * Reconcile potentially contradictory information\n     * Identify complementary information across different sources\n     * Recognize emergent patterns not visible in any single source\n     * Synthesize a coherent understanding of mechanisms and relationships\n\n## HANDOFF OPTIMIZATION\n\nUse each specialized agent strategically based on their unique strengths:\n\n1. PubMed Agent (peer-reviewed literature expert):\n   - Use for: Established mechanisms, validated pathways, clinical correlations\n   - Best when: Seeking high-quality evidence from peer-reviewed sources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for validated molecular interactions between TNF-alpha and IL-6 signaling in rheumatoid arthritis synovium, focusing on mechanisms supported by multiple studies.\"\n\n2. BioRxiv Agent (preprint specialist):\n   - Use for: Emerging concepts, cutting-edge methods, newest discoveries\n   - Best when: Established literature is limited or potentially outdated\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the latest preprints on JAK-STAT inhibition in systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly novel mechanisms or targets not yet in peer-reviewed literature.\"\n\n3. Europe PMC Agent (comprehensive literature database):\n   - Use for: Broad coverage across journals, open access content, systematic reviews\n   - Best when: Need comprehensive literature analysis on a specific concept\n   - Example handoff: \"Search for comprehensive reviews and primary research on the role of ACPA in bone erosion mechanisms in rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\n4. Semantic Scholar Agent (citation network specialist):\n   - Use for: Highly influential papers, research impact assessment, interdisciplinary connections\n   - Best when: Need to identify seminal papers or cross-disciplinary insights\n   - Example handoff: \"Find the most highly-cited papers connecting microbiome dysbiosis to autoantibody production in rheumatic diseases, focusing on mechanistic studies.\"\n\n5. Firecrawl Agent (multi-source research tool):\n   - Use for: Broad searches across multiple scientific domains, clinical guidelines\n   - Best when: Topic spans multiple disciplines or resources\n   - Example handoff: \"Search across clinical and basic science resources for evidence connecting environmental triggers to flares in psoriatic arthritis, including both molecular mechanisms and clinical observations.\"\n\n6. Hetionet Agent (knowledge graph specialist):\n   - Use for: Discovering existing network connections, biological pathways, gene-disease associations\n   - Best when: Need to establish known relationships between entities\n   - Example handoff: \"Find all connections between HLA-B27 and inflammatory pathways relevant to axial spondyloarthritis in the existing knowledge graph.\"\n\n## SYNTHESIS APPROACH\n\nAfter collecting information from specialized agents:\n\n1. Create Unstructured Sources (3-5):\n   - Synthesize the most valuable information from all agent responses\n   - Extract clear mechanistic relationships and causal pathways\n   - Include quantitative data supporting key relationships\n   - Organize information to highlight connections between subgraph entities\n   - Maintain proper attribution to original sources\n\n2. Generate Knowledge Graphs (1-2):\n   - Construct coherent extensions to the original subgraph\n   - Focus on mechanistic connections with clear directionality\n   - Include properties that provide clinical and biological context\n   - Ensure nodes and edges are precisely defined with relationship types\n   - Connect new elements logically to the original subgraph entities\n\n## RHEUMATOLOGY DOMAIN FOCUS\n\nPrioritize enrichment related to these key areas:\n- Autoimmune mechanisms (T-cell, B-cell, innate immunity pathways)\n- Inflammatory cascades and cytokine networks\n- Genetic risk factors and their functional consequences\n- Tissue-specific disease manifestations and mechanisms\n- Therapeutic targets and response biomarkers\n- Disease subtypes and precision medicine approaches\n\nYour goal is to produce a comprehensive, mechanistically detailed enrichment of the original subgraph by intelligently orchestrating specialized research agents and synthesizing their findings into a coherent knowledge representation.\n\n## SEARCH AND INFORMATION GATHERING PROTOCOL\n\nWhen your analysis requires external information (e.g., checking novelty, verifying claims, finding supporting/contradicting evidence, exploring alternative mechanisms):\n\n1.  **Assess Information Need:** Clearly define the specific information you are looking for.\n2.  **Evaluate Confidence:** Honestly assess your confidence in your current knowledge regarding the specific information needed. Are you certain about the answer or the best way to find it?\n3.  **Utilize Available Tools/Handoffs:**\n    * If you are **uncertain**, lack specific domain knowledge for the query, require information from a specialized source (like preprints, specific databases, or existing knowledge graphs), or believe a more focused search is necessary, you **MUST** utilize the appropriate tools or handoff agents provided to you (refer to your configured `tools` and `handoffs`).\n    * Do **not** attempt to answer from memory or general knowledge if external verification or specialized search is warranted and available resources exist.\n    * Formulate precise queries or instructions for the tool/agent you are calling. Provide necessary context from your current task.\n4.  **Synthesize Results:** Integrate the information obtained from tools/handoffs back into your primary analysis. Your core responsibility is [mention agent's main function, e.g., 'critical assessment', 'evidence verification', 'hypothesis refinement'], rely on specialized resources for information retrieval when appropriate.\n\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT TASK - MANDATORY EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\n## MANDATE\nYou are an expert rheumatology ontology coordinator. Your primary goal in this task is **NOT** just to analyze the provided subgraph, but to **actively enrich and validate it using external, current information obtained via mandatory handoffs to your specialized research agents.** You MUST NOT rely solely on the information present in the initial subgraph or your internal knowledge base for generating the enrichment output.\n\n## SUBGRAPH TO

pathway, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis\n\n## CONTEXTUAL ONTOLOGY INFORMATION\nThe following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"### Primary Section: Relationship Synthesis\\n\\n1. **Novel Therapeutic Approaches \u2192 IL-17 Pathways \u2192 NF-kB Inhibition**: Novel therapies targeting the IL-17 pathway not only affect downstream cytokine signaling but also inhibit NF-kB activation, a central node in inflammatory processes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This inhibition reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which is critical in RA pathogenesis.\\n   \\n2. **Epigenetic Modifications \u2192 Histone Acetylation \u2192 NF-kB Pathway**: Epigenetic changes such as histone acetylation can lead to altered gene expression profiles in immune cells, impacting both IL-17 production and NF-kB activity, which are pivotal in chronic inflammation associated with autoimmune disorders.\\n\\n3. **microRNAs \u2192 IL-17 and NF-kB Regulation**: Specific miRNAs are involved in the fine-tuning of IL-17 and NF-kB signaling pathways by targeting mRNAs that encode key regulatory proteins. For instance, miRNAs can potentially downregulate proteins that activate the NF-kB pathway, thereby reducing inflammation.\\n\\n4. **Transcription Factors \u2192 Cytokine Signaling \u2192 NF-kB**: Transcription factors that contribute to immune cell differentiation often modulate cytokine production, impacting both IL-17 levels and NF-kB pathway activity. This interconnection is critical for maintaining a balance in inflammatory responses.\\n\\n5. **IL-17 Pathways \u2192 Genetic Variations \u2192 Epigenetic Regulation**: Genetic variations in IL17A and IL17F genes can lead to different responses to treatment, influencing how epigenetic modifications like histone acetylation regulate the expression of genes involved in NF-kB signaling.\\n\\n### Evidence Assessment Section\\n\\n- **Consistency Across Studies**: Studies consistently show a direct impact of novel therapies on both IL-17 and NF-kB pathways, but differences in patient-specific genetic variations may lead to varied therapeutic outcomes.\\n- **Methodological Quality**: Many studies are based on robust methodologies, including randomized controlled trials and gene expression analyses, echoing reliability.\\n- **Knowledge Gaps**: Limited data exists on the interaction between specific miRNAs and NF-kB regulation in the context of IL-17 targeting therapies. More empirical research is required to understand these molecular dynamics fully.\\n\\n### Source Documentation Section\\n\\n1. **Hirano, T., et al., \\\"Novel therapeutic approaches targeting IL-17 and its downstream effects on NF-kB signaling in rheumatoid arthritis\\\", *Journal of Immunology Updates*, 2023.

IL-23, which stimulates MMP production. MMPs degrade extracellular matrix components, facilitating fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS) recruitment and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokine release that drive osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. Denosumab, known as an anti-RANKL therapy, is implicated in reducing osteoporotic fractures and appears to modulate MMP expression.\",\n    \"Key connections identified: IL-23 modulates Th17 cells, which in turn increase MMP production and FLS recruitment. This cascade contributes to osteoclast differentiation and bone tissue resorption.

pathway, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis\n\n## CONTEXTUAL ONTOLOGY INFORMATION\nThe following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"### Primary Section: Relationship Synthesis\\n\\n1. **Novel Therapeutic Approaches \u2192 IL-17 Pathways \u2192 NF-kB Inhibition**: Novel therapies targeting the IL-17 pathway not only affect downstream cytokine signaling but also inhibit NF-kB activation, a central node in inflammatory processes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This inhibition reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which is critical in RA pathogenesis.\\n   \\n2. **Epigenetic Modifications \u2192 Histone Acetylation \u2192 NF-kB Pathway**: Epigenetic changes such as histone acetylation can lead to altered gene expression profiles in immune cells, impacting both IL-17 production and NF-kB activity, which are pivotal in chronic inflammation associated with autoimmune disorders.\\n\\n3. **microRNAs \u2192 IL-17 and NF-kB Regulation**: Specific miRNAs are involved in the fine-tuning of IL-17 and NF-kB signaling pathways by targeting mRNAs that encode key regulatory proteins. For instance, miRNAs can potentially downregulate proteins that activate the NF-kB pathway, thereby reducing inflammation.\\n\\n4. **Transcription Factors \u2192 Cytokine Signaling \u2192 NF-kB**: Transcription factors that contribute to immune cell differentiation often modulate cytokine production, impacting both IL-17 levels and NF-kB pathway activity. This interconnection is critical for maintaining a balance in inflammatory responses.\\n\\n5. **IL-17 Pathways \u2192 Genetic Variations \u2192 Epigenetic Regulation**: Genetic variations in IL17A and IL17F genes can lead to different responses to treatment, influencing how epigenetic modifications like histone acetylation regulate the expression of genes involved in NF-kB signaling.\\n\\n### Evidence Assessment Section\\n\\n- **Consistency Across Studies**: Studies consistently show a direct impact of novel therapies on both IL-17 and NF-kB pathways, but differences in patient-specific genetic variations may lead to varied therapeutic outcomes.\\n- **Methodological Quality**: Many studies are based on robust methodologies, including randomized controlled trials and gene expression analyses, echoing reliability.\\n- **Knowledge Gaps**: Limited data exists on the interaction between specific miRNAs and NF-kB regulation in the context of IL-17 targeting therapies. More empirical research is required to understand these molecular dynamics fully.\\n\\n### Source Documentation Section\\n\\n1. **Hirano, T., et al., \\\"Novel therapeutic approaches targeting IL-17 and its downstream effects on NF-kB signaling in rheumatoid arthritis\\\", *Journal of Immunology Updates*, 2023.

understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"### Primary Section: Relationship Synthesis\\n\\n1. **Novel Therapeutic Approaches \u2192 IL-17 Pathways \u2192 NF-kB Inhibition**: Novel therapies targeting the IL-17 pathway not only affect downstream cytokine signaling but also inhibit NF-kB activation, a central node in inflammatory processes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This inhibition reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which is critical in RA pathogenesis.\\n   \\n2. **Epigenetic Modifications \u2192 Histone Acetylation \u2192 NF-kB Pathway**: Epigenetic changes such as histone acetylation can lead to altered gene expression profiles in immune cells, impacting both IL-17 production and NF-kB activity, which are pivotal in chronic inflammation associated with autoimmune disorders.\\n\\n3. **microRNAs \u2192 IL-17 and NF-kB Regulation**: Specific miRNAs are involved in the fine-tuning of IL-17 and NF-kB signaling pathways by targeting mRNAs that encode key regulatory proteins. For instance, miRNAs can potentially downregulate proteins that activate the NF-kB pathway, thereby reducing inflammation.\\n\\n4. **Transcription Factors \u2192 Cytokine Signaling \u2192 NF-kB**: Transcription factors that contribute to immune cell differentiation often modulate cytokine production, impacting both IL-17 levels and NF-kB pathway activity. This interconnection is critical for maintaining a balance in inflammatory responses.\\n\\n5. **IL-17 Pathways \u2192 Genetic Variations \u2192 Epigenetic Regulation**: Genetic variations in IL17A and IL17F genes can lead to different responses to treatment, influencing how epigenetic modifications like histone acetylation regulate the expression of genes involved in NF-kB signaling.\\n\\n### Evidence Assessment Section\\n\\n- **Consistency Across Studies**: Studies consistently show a direct impact of novel therapies on both IL-17 and NF-kB pathways, but differences in patient-specific genetic variations may lead to varied therapeutic outcomes.\\n- **Methodological Quality**: Many studies are based on robust methodologies, including randomized controlled trials and gene expression analyses, echoing reliability.\\n- **Knowledge Gaps**: Limited data exists on the interaction between specific miRNAs and NF-kB regulation in the context of IL-17 targeting therapies. More empirical research is required to understand these molecular dynamics fully.\\n\\n### Source Documentation Section\\n\\n1. **Hirano, T., et al., \\\"Novel therapeutic approaches targeting IL-17 and its downstream effects on NF-kB signaling in rheumatoid arthritis\\\", *Journal of Immunology Updates*, 2023.

understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"### Primary Section: Relationship Synthesis\\n\\n1. **Novel Therapeutic Approaches \u2192 IL-17 Pathways \u2192 NF-kB Inhibition**: Novel therapies targeting the IL-17 pathway not only affect downstream cytokine signaling but also inhibit NF-kB activation, a central node in inflammatory processes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This inhibition reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which is critical in RA pathogenesis.\\n   \\n2. **Epigenetic Modifications \u2192 Histone Acetylation \u2192 NF-kB Pathway**: Epigenetic changes such as histone acetylation can lead to altered gene expression profiles in immune cells, impacting both IL-17 production and NF-kB activity, which are pivotal in chronic inflammation associated with autoimmune disorders.\\n\\n3. **microRNAs \u2192 IL-17 and NF-kB Regulation**: Specific miRNAs are involved in the fine-tuning of IL-17 and NF-kB signaling pathways by targeting mRNAs that encode key regulatory proteins. For instance, miRNAs can potentially downregulate proteins that activate the NF-kB pathway, thereby reducing inflammation.\\n\\n4. **Transcription Factors \u2192 Cytokine Signaling \u2192 NF-kB**: Transcription factors that contribute to immune cell differentiation often modulate cytokine production, impacting both IL-17 levels and NF-kB pathway activity. This interconnection is critical for maintaining a balance in inflammatory responses.\\n\\n5. **IL-17 Pathways \u2192 Genetic Variations \u2192 Epigenetic Regulation**: Genetic variations in IL17A and IL17F genes can lead to different responses to treatment, influencing how epigenetic modifications like histone acetylation regulate the expression of genes involved in NF-kB signaling.\\n\\n### Evidence Assessment Section\\n\\n- **Consistency Across Studies**: Studies consistently show a direct impact of novel therapies on both IL-17 and NF-kB pathways, but differences in patient-specific genetic variations may lead to varied therapeutic outcomes.\\n- **Methodological Quality**: Many studies are based on robust methodologies, including randomized controlled trials and gene expression analyses, echoing reliability.\\n- **Knowledge Gaps**: Limited data exists on the interaction between specific miRNAs and NF-kB regulation in the context of IL-17 targeting therapies. More empirical research is required to understand these molecular dynamics fully.\\n\\n### Source Documentation Section\\n\\n1. **Hirano, T., et al., \\\"Novel therapeutic approaches targeting IL-17 and its downstream effects on NF-kB signaling in rheumatoid arthritis\\\", *Journal of Immunology Updates*, 2023.

The autoantibody production phase influences epigenetic modifications in T cells that can be exacerbated by environmental factors (e.g., smoking), leading to enhanced TNF-alpha production and subsequent activation of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"### Primary Section: Relationship Synthesis\\n\\n1. **Novel Therapeutic Approaches \u2192 IL-17 Pathways \u2192 NF-kB Inhibition**: Novel therapies targeting the IL-17 pathway not only affect downstream cytokine signaling but also inhibit NF-kB activation, a central node in inflammatory processes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This inhibition reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which is critical in RA pathogenesis.\\n   \\n2. **Epigenetic Modifications \u2192 Histone Acetylation \u2192 NF-kB Pathway**: Epigenetic changes such as histone acetylation can lead to altered gene expression profiles in immune cells, impacting both IL-17 production and NF-kB activity, which are pivotal in chronic inflammation associated with autoimmune disorders.\\n\\n3. **microRNAs \u2192 IL-17 and NF-kB Regulation**: Specific miRNAs are involved in the fine-tuning of IL-17 and NF-kB signaling pathways by targeting mRNAs that encode key regulatory proteins. For instance, miRNAs can potentially downregulate proteins that activate the NF-kB pathway, thereby reducing inflammation.\\n\\n4. **Transcription Factors \u2192 Cytokine Signaling \u2192 NF-kB**: Transcription factors that contribute to immune cell differentiation often modulate cytokine production, impacting both IL-17 levels and NF-kB pathway activity. This interconnection is critical for maintaining a balance in inflammatory responses.\\n\\n5. **IL-17 Pathways \u2192 Genetic Variations \u2192 Epigenetic Regulation**: Genetic variations in IL17A and IL17F genes can lead to different responses to treatment, influencing how epigenetic modifications like histone acetylation regulate the expression of genes involved in NF-kB signaling.\\n\\n### Evidence Assessment Section\\n\\n- **Consistency Across Studies**: Studies consistently show a direct impact of novel therapies on both IL-17 and NF-kB pathways, but differences in patient-specific genetic variations may lead to varied therapeutic outcomes.\\n- **Methodological Quality**: Many studies are based on robust methodologies, including randomized controlled trials and gene expression analyses, echoing reliability.\\n- **Knowledge Gaps**: Limited data exists on the interaction between specific miRNAs and NF-kB regulation in the context of IL-17 targeting therapies. More empirical research is required to understand these molecular dynamics fully.\\n\\n### Source Documentation Section\\n\\n1. **Hirano, T., et al., \\\"Novel therapeutic approaches targeting IL-17 and its downstream effects on NF-kB signaling in rheumatoid arthritis\\\", *Journal of Immunology Updates*, 2023.

understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"### Primary Section: Relationship Synthesis\\n\\n1. **Novel Therapeutic Approaches \u2192 IL-17 Pathways \u2192 NF-kB Inhibition**: Novel therapies targeting the IL-17 pathway not only affect downstream cytokine signaling but also inhibit NF-kB activation, a central node in inflammatory processes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This inhibition reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which is critical in RA pathogenesis.\\n   \\n2. **Epigenetic Modifications \u2192 Histone Acetylation \u2192 NF-kB Pathway**: Epigenetic changes such as histone acetylation can lead to altered gene expression profiles in immune cells, impacting both IL-17 production and NF-kB activity, which are pivotal in chronic inflammation associated with autoimmune disorders.\\n\\n3. **microRNAs \u2192 IL-17 and NF-kB Regulation**: Specific miRNAs are involved in the fine-tuning of IL-17 and NF-kB signaling pathways by targeting mRNAs that encode key regulatory proteins. For instance, miRNAs can potentially downregulate proteins that activate the NF-kB pathway, thereby reducing inflammation.\\n\\n4. **Transcription Factors \u2192 Cytokine Signaling \u2192 NF-kB**: Transcription factors that contribute to immune cell differentiation often modulate cytokine production, impacting both IL-17 levels and NF-kB pathway activity. This interconnection is critical for maintaining a balance in inflammatory responses.\\n\\n5. **IL-17 Pathways \u2192 Genetic Variations \u2192 Epigenetic Regulation**: Genetic variations in IL17A and IL17F genes can lead to different responses to treatment, influencing how epigenetic modifications like histone acetylation regulate the expression of genes involved in NF-kB signaling.\\n\\n### Evidence Assessment Section\\n\\n- **Consistency Across Studies**: Studies consistently show a direct impact of novel therapies on both IL-17 and NF-kB pathways, but differences in patient-specific genetic variations may lead to varied therapeutic outcomes.\\n- **Methodological Quality**: Many studies are based on robust methodologies, including randomized controlled trials and gene expression analyses, echoing reliability.\\n- **Knowledge Gaps**: Limited data exists on the interaction between specific miRNAs and NF-kB regulation in the context of IL-17 targeting therapies. More empirical research is required to understand these molecular dynamics fully.\\n\\n### Source Documentation Section\\n\\n1. **Hirano, T., et al., \\\"Novel therapeutic approaches targeting IL-17 and its downstream effects on NF-kB signaling in rheumatoid arthritis\\\", *Journal of Immunology Updates*, 2023.

pathway, contributing to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis\n\n## CONTEXTUAL ONTOLOGY INFORMATION\nThe following additional ontological information has been provided to enrich your understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"### Primary Section: Relationship Synthesis\\n\\n1. **Novel Therapeutic Approaches \u2192 IL-17 Pathways \u2192 NF-kB Inhibition**: Novel therapies targeting the IL-17 pathway not only affect downstream cytokine signaling but also inhibit NF-kB activation, a central node in inflammatory processes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This inhibition reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which is critical in RA pathogenesis.\\n   \\n2. **Epigenetic Modifications \u2192 Histone Acetylation \u2192 NF-kB Pathway**: Epigenetic changes such as histone acetylation can lead to altered gene expression profiles in immune cells, impacting both IL-17 production and NF-kB activity, which are pivotal in chronic inflammation associated with autoimmune disorders.\\n\\n3. **microRNAs \u2192 IL-17 and NF-kB Regulation**: Specific miRNAs are involved in the fine-tuning of IL-17 and NF-kB signaling pathways by targeting mRNAs that encode key regulatory proteins. For instance, miRNAs can potentially downregulate proteins that activate the NF-kB pathway, thereby reducing inflammation.\\n\\n4. **Transcription Factors \u2192 Cytokine Signaling \u2192 NF-kB**: Transcription factors that contribute to immune cell differentiation often modulate cytokine production, impacting both IL-17 levels and NF-kB pathway activity. This interconnection is critical for maintaining a balance in inflammatory responses.\\n\\n5. **IL-17 Pathways \u2192 Genetic Variations \u2192 Epigenetic Regulation**: Genetic variations in IL17A and IL17F genes can lead to different responses to treatment, influencing how epigenetic modifications like histone acetylation regulate the expression of genes involved in NF-kB signaling.\\n\\n### Evidence Assessment Section\\n\\n- **Consistency Across Studies**: Studies consistently show a direct impact of novel therapies on both IL-17 and NF-kB pathways, but differences in patient-specific genetic variations may lead to varied therapeutic outcomes.\\n- **Methodological Quality**: Many studies are based on robust methodologies, including randomized controlled trials and gene expression analyses, echoing reliability.\\n- **Knowledge Gaps**: Limited data exists on the interaction between specific miRNAs and NF-kB regulation in the context of IL-17 targeting therapies. More empirical research is required to understand these molecular dynamics fully.\\n\\n### Source Documentation Section\\n\\n1. **Hirano, T., et al., \\\"Novel therapeutic approaches targeting IL-17 and its downstream effects on NF-kB signaling in rheumatoid arthritis\\\", *Journal of Immunology Updates*, 2023.

NOVELTY: Proposes connections not extensively studied in literature\n2. BIOLOGICAL PLAUSIBILITY: Consistent with established mechanisms and pathways\n3. SPECIFICITY: Defines a clear, detailed mechanism rather than vague associations\n4. TESTABILITY: Can be evaluated through feasible experimental approaches\n5. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Has potential implications for diagnosis, treatment, or prevention\n6. FALSIFIABILITY: Makes predictions that could prove the hypothesis incorrect\n\n## INPUT PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS\nYou will receive an OntologyAgentInput containing:\n1. A subgraph with nodes and relationships to analyze\n2. Potentially additional knowledge graphs and unstructured sources\n\nFor processing this input:\n- Thoroughly examine all nodes and relationships in the provided subgraph\n- Work with whatever mechanisms, entities, and relationships are present in the input\n- Identify the most biologically meaningful paths between key concepts\n- Focus on unexpected or underexplored connections that suggest knowledge gaps\n- Consider both explicit connections and implicit relationships that could be inferred\n- Pay special attention to nodes that bridge disparate biological processes\n- Do not introduce mechanisms that are not supported by the input data\n\n## OUTPUT STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS\nGenerate a comprehensive ScientificHypothesis with:\n\n1. title: Create a concise, specific title that clearly communicates the core hypothesis\n\n2. statement: Formulate a precise hypothesis statement that specifies:\n   - The key entities and their proposed relationship\n   - The direction and nature of the effect\n   - The specific mechanism of action based on the input data\n   - Any relevant conditions or contexts\n\n3. summary: Provide a 1-2 sentence distillation of the core hypothesis\n\n4. mechanism: Detail the MechanismDetail with:\n   - pathway_description: The complete biological pathway involved\n   - key_entities: All critical molecules, cells, or processes from the input\n   - molecular_interactions: Specific binding, signaling, or regulatory events\n   - cellular_processes: Relevant cell behaviors or state changes\n\n5. expected_outcomes: List specific, measurable outcomes if the hypothesis is correct\n\n6. experimental_approaches: Propose 3-5 concrete methods to test the hypothesis\n\n7. references: Provide relevant HypothesisReference objects that support aspects of your hypothesis\n\n8. keywords: 5-10 specific terms relevant to your hypothesis\n\n9. agent_reasoning: Document your step-by-step reasoning process, including:\n   - Initial observations from the subgraph\n   - Identification of key connections\n   - Potential alternative explanations considered\n   - Justification for the selected mechanism\n   - Assessment against evaluation criteria\n\n10. iteration_count and refinement_history: Set appropriately for your generation process\n\nYour hypothesis should integrate the perspectives and information provided in the input while maintaining scientific precision and clarity. Focus on identifying the most biologically coherent pathways that suggest novel therapeutic targets, biomarkers, or disease mechanisms based strictly on the provided data.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n# HYPOTHESIS GENERATION TASK\n\n## SUBGRAPH DEFINITION\nThe following knowledge graph subgraph represents relationships between biomedical entities.

understanding:\n\n<ontology>\n{\n  \"content\": \"### Primary Section: Relationship Synthesis\\n\\n1. **Novel Therapeutic Approaches \u2192 IL-17 Pathways \u2192 NF-kB Inhibition**: Novel therapies targeting the IL-17 pathway not only affect downstream cytokine signaling but also inhibit NF-kB activation, a central node in inflammatory processes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This inhibition reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which is critical in RA pathogenesis.\\n   \\n2. **Epigenetic Modifications \u2192 Histone Acetylation \u2192 NF-kB Pathway**: Epigenetic changes such as histone acetylation can lead to altered gene expression profiles in immune cells, impacting both IL-17 production and NF-kB activity, which are pivotal in chronic inflammation associated with autoimmune disorders.\\n\\n3. **microRNAs \u2192 IL-17 and NF-kB Regulation**: Specific miRNAs are involved in the fine-tuning of IL-17 and NF-kB signaling pathways by targeting mRNAs that encode key regulatory proteins. For instance, miRNAs can potentially downregulate proteins that activate the NF-kB pathway, thereby reducing inflammation.\\n\\n4. **Transcription Factors \u2192 Cytokine Signaling \u2192 NF-kB**: Transcription factors that contribute to immune cell differentiation often modulate cytokine production, impacting both IL-17 levels and NF-kB pathway activity. This interconnection is critical for maintaining a balance in inflammatory responses.\\n\\n5. **IL-17 Pathways \u2192 Genetic Variations \u2192 Epigenetic Regulation**: Genetic variations in IL17A and IL17F genes can lead to different responses to treatment, influencing how epigenetic modifications like histone acetylation regulate the expression of genes involved in NF-kB signaling.\\n\\n### Evidence Assessment Section\\n\\n- **Consistency Across Studies**: Studies consistently show a direct impact of novel therapies on both IL-17 and NF-kB pathways, but differences in patient-specific genetic variations may lead to varied therapeutic outcomes.\\n- **Methodological Quality**: Many studies are based on robust methodologies, including randomized controlled trials and gene expression analyses, echoing reliability.\\n- **Knowledge Gaps**: Limited data exists on the interaction between specific miRNAs and NF-kB regulation in the context of IL-17 targeting therapies. More empirical research is required to understand these molecular dynamics fully.\\n\\n### Source Documentation Section\\n\\n1. **Hirano, T., et al., \\\"Novel therapeutic approaches targeting IL-17 and its downstream effects on NF-kB signaling in rheumatoid arthritis\\\", *Journal of Immunology Updates*, 2023.

For instance, miRNAs can potentially downregulate proteins that activate the NF-kB pathway, thereby reducing inflammation.\\n\\n4. **Transcription Factors \u2192 Cytokine Signaling \u2192 NF-kB**: Transcription factors that contribute to immune cell differentiation often modulate cytokine production, impacting both IL-17 levels and NF-kB pathway activity. This interconnection is critical for maintaining a balance in inflammatory responses.\\n\\n5. **IL-17 Pathways \u2192 Genetic Variations \u2192 Epigenetic Regulation**: Genetic variations in IL17A and IL17F genes can lead to different responses to treatment, influencing how epigenetic modifications like histone acetylation regulate the expression of genes involved in NF-kB signaling.\\n\\n### Evidence Assessment Section\\n\\n- **Consistency Across Studies**: Studies consistently show a direct impact of novel therapies on both IL-17 and NF-kB pathways, but differences in patient-specific genetic variations may lead to varied therapeutic outcomes.\\n- **Methodological Quality**: Many studies are based on robust methodologies, including randomized controlled trials and gene expression analyses, echoing reliability.\\n- **Knowledge Gaps**: Limited data exists on the interaction between specific miRNAs and NF-kB regulation in the context of IL-17 targeting therapies. More empirical research is required to understand these molecular dynamics fully.\\n\\n### Source Documentation Section\\n\\n1. **Hirano, T., et al., \\\"Novel therapeutic approaches targeting IL-17 and its downstream effects on NF-kB signaling in rheumatoid arthritis\\\", *Journal of Immunology Updates*, 2023.

Your mission is to leverage Semantic Scholar's unique capabilities to extract high-impact scientific relationships from the literature that will enrich knowledge graphs for hypothesis generation.\n\n## SEMANTIC SCHOLAR SEARCH OPTIMIZATION\n\nWhen given a rheumatology keyword or concept:\n\n1. Design a multi-dimensional search strategy:\n   - Formulate precise query terms capturing exact concepts (e.g., \"synovial hyperplasia\" rather than \"joint swelling\")\n   - Include both specific terminology and established synonyms (e.g., \"rheumatoid arthritis\" AND \"RA\")\n   - For molecular entities: include standard nomenclature variants (e.g., \"TNF-alpha\", \"TNFA\", \"tumor necrosis factor alpha\")\n   - For diseases: incorporate both clinical and molecular classifications (e.g., \"ANCA-associated vasculitis\" AND \"granulomatosis with polyangiitis\")\n\n2. Leverage Semantic Scholar's strengths:\n   - Focus on highly-cited papers (citation count >50) to identify seminal research\n   - Utilize the \"fieldsOfStudy\" parameter to target papers at the intersection of multiple fields (e.g., \"immunology\" AND \"rheumatology\" AND \"molecular biology\")\n   - Look for papers with strong citation connections that indicate integration across research areas\n   - Balance between classic, foundational papers and recent publications (last 3 years)\n\n## RELATIONSHIP EXTRACTION APPROACH\n\nAfter retrieving search results:\n\n1. Identify papers establishing causal mechanisms with these characteristics:\n   - Direct experimental evidence of molecular pathways\n   - Clear directional relationships between biological entities\n   - Quantitative measurement of effects with statistical validation\n   - Multiple complementary methods supporting the same conclusion\n   - Validation across different biological systems (cells, animal models, human samples)\n\n2. Extract these specific relationship types:\n   - Molecular regulation: Entity A increases/decreases Entity B through specified mechanism\n   - Biological activation: Entity A activates/inhibits Process B in specific cell types\n   - Genetic influence: Variant A affects Expression/Function of Gene B by specific mechanism\n   - Therapeutic action: Compound A modulates Target B leading to Outcome C\n   - Diagnostic correlation: Biomarker A predicts Clinical Outcome B with specified accuracy\n\n3. Focus on finding network connections:\n   - Identify papers that connect previously unrelated entities\n   - Look for multi-step pathways linking disparate processes\n   - Seek mechanistic explanations for clinical observations\n   - Find bridging concepts that connect different research areas\n\n## OUTPUT STRUCTURE FOR KNOWLEDGE GRAPH ENRICHMENT\n\n1. Introduction (10% of content):\n   - Summarize the most significant causal relationship patterns found\n   - Highlight any unexpected connections discovered\n   - Note the strength of evidence supporting key findings\n\n2. Detailed relationship section (60% of content):\n   - Present 3-5 key relationships in explicit subject-predicate-object format\n   - Specify relationship directionality, mechanism, and context\n   - Include quantitative measures where available (effect sizes, p-values)\n   - Group related relationships to show interconnected pathways\n   - Use consistent terminology suitable for knowledge graph integration\n\n3. Evidence quality assessment (15% of content):\n   - Evaluate consistency of findings across multiple sources\n   - Assess methodological strength of supporting studies\n   - Note limitations or contradictory evidence\n   - Identify knowledge gaps requiring further investigation\n\n4. Source documentation (15% of content):\n   - For each key finding: [Authors, \"Title\", Journal, Year, DOI or URL]\n   - Include citation metrics (total citations, citation velocity)\n   - Note institutional affiliations of key research groups\n\n## RHEUMATOLOGY-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS\n\nFocus on extracting relationships relevant to:\n- Autoimmune pathway mechanisms (e.g., T-cell differentiation, B-cell activation, autoantibody production)\n- Cytokine network interactions in different disease phases\n- Genetic risk factors and their functional consequences\n- Tissue-specific manifestations and molecular drivers\n- Novel therapeutic targets and mechanisms\n- Biomarkers with mechanistic significance\n- Disease subtypes and their distinct molecular signatures\n\nYour output should provide the ontology agent with precisely structured relationship information from high-impact Semantic Scholar sources that reveals non-obvious connections, mechanisms, and potential intervention points in rheumatic diseases.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # STATEMENT VERIFICATION TASK\n\n    Please verify the following scientific statement by searching for supporting and contradicting evidence:\n\n    ## STATEMENT TO VERIFY\n\n    \"Treatment with IL-17 inhibitors alters the expression profile of specific microRNAs in immune cells and synovial tissues of RA patients.\"\n\n    ## PROPOSED FALSIFICATION METHOD\n\n    Utilize RNA sequencing or microarray analysis to compare miRNA expression profiles in samples from RA patients pre- and post-IL-17 targeted therapy.\n\n    ## EXISTING SUPPORTING EVIDENCE (IF ANY)\n\n    Emerging data on the role of miRNAs in the regulation of inflammatory pathways supports this component of the mechanism.\n\n    ## EXISTING CONTRADICTING EVIDENCE (IF ANY)\n\n    None provided\n\n    Please conduct a thorough search using the available tools to find both supporting and contradicting evidence.\n    Then provide a comprehensive verification assessment.\n    "}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_j72byrjaK60BgMiMqy5NZJa0", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "transfer_to_semantic_scholar_agent", "arguments": "{\"query\": \"IL-17 inhibitors microRNA expression profile immune cells synovial tissues RA RNA sequencing IL-17 blockade microRNA regulation in rheumatoid arthritis\"}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "call_j72byrjaK60BgMiMqy5NZJa0", "content": "{'assistant': 'Semantic Scholar Agent'}"}], "output": [{"content": null, "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_Hk8ZU5dNMg96mUFXlVl8ZpI5", "function": {"arguments": "{\"keyword\": \"IL-17 inhibitors microRNA expression profile immune cells synovial tissues RA\"}", "name": "get_semanticscholar_papers_by_keyword"}, "type": "function"}, {"id": "call_q1uQkxk6vcBiUKapP8xgkgou", "function": {"arguments": "{\"keyword\": \"RNA sequencing IL-17 blockade microRNA regulation in rheumatoid arthritis\"}", "name": "get_semanticscholar_papers_by_keyword"}, "type": "function"}]}], "model": "gpt-4o", "model_config": {"temperature": null, "top_p": null, "frequency_penalty": null, "presence_penalty": null, "tool_choice": "required", "parallel_tool_calls": null, "truncation": null, "max_tokens": null, "reasoning": null, "metadata": null, "store": null, "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/"}, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1304, "output_tokens": 84}}, "error": null}

Implement a structured search strategy:\n   - Convert general concepts into precise MeSH terms when applicable (e.g., \"rheumatoid arthritis\" \u2192 \"Arthritis, Rheumatoid\"[Mesh])\n   - Add relationship-specific modifiers to focus on mechanisms (e.g., \"pathogenesis\", \"signaling\", \"regulation\", \"mechanism\")\n   - Include methodology terms for higher-quality evidence (e.g., \"randomized controlled trial\", \"meta-analysis\", \"systematic review\")\n   - Apply Boolean operators strategically to narrow results to manageable, high-relevance sets\n   - For genes/proteins: include both official symbols and common alternatives (e.g., \"TNFA\" AND \"TNF-alpha\")\n\n2. Prioritize high-impact sources:\n   - Focus on articles from journals with impact factor >4 when possible\n   - Include both seminal papers (high citation count) and recent publications (last 2-3 years)\n   - Target studies with robust methodology (adequate sample size, appropriate controls, validated techniques)\n   - Look specifically for papers establishing causal relationships rather than mere associations\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY\n\nWhen analyzing search results:\n\n1. Focus extraction on specific relationship types:\n   - Regulatory relationships (e.g., \"IL-17 upregulates MMP-3 expression in synovial fibroblasts\")\n   - Signal transduction pathways (e.g., \"MAPK mediates TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation in synoviocytes\")\n   - Genetic influences on disease mechanisms (e.g., \"HLA-DRB1 shared epitope enhances ACPA production\")\n   - Therapeutic mechanisms of action (e.g., \"JAK inhibition blocks STAT3 phosphorylation reducing IL-6 signaling\")\n   - Biomarker correlations with measurable outcomes (e.g., \"Serum CXCL13 levels correlate with synovitis severity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n\n2. Extract quantitative data to support relationships:\n   - Effect sizes with confidence intervals\n   - Sensitivity/specificity values for biomarkers\n   - Dose-response relationships\n   - Temporal dynamics of biological processes\n   - Statistical significance measures (p-values, q-values)\n\n3. Capture methodological context:\n   - Experimental systems used (human patients, animal models, cell lines)\n   - Key technologies employed (RNA-seq, proteomics, CRISPR, etc.)\n   - Validation approaches supporting findings\n   - Limitations explicitly acknowledged by authors\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\nStructure your response for maximum value to the ontology agent:\n\n1. Primary section - Relationship synthesis (60% of content):\n   - Present 3-5 key causal relationships in subject-predicate-object format\n   - Clearly specify directionality (increases/decreases, activates/inhibits)\n   - Include quantitative measures of relationship strength\n   - Group related findings to show pathway connections\n   - Highlight unexpected or novel relationships that could inform hypothesis generation\n\n2. Evidence assessment section (20% of content):\n   - Evaluate consistency across multiple studies\n   - Note contradictory findings with potential explanations\n   - Assess methodological quality of supporting evidence\n   - Identify knowledge gaps or areas of uncertainty\n\n3.

Carefully analyze the given scientific statement to understand its claims, scope, and implications\n2. Formulate strategic search queries to find relevant scientific literature using the available tools\n3. Search for both supporting AND contradicting evidence for the statement\n4. Analyze the collected evidence and draw a conclusion about the statement's validity\n5. Provide a structured assessment including supporting evidence, contradicting evidence, and your overall conclusion\n\n## SEARCH STRATEGY GUIDELINES\n\nFor effective verification:\n1. Break down the statement into its core components for targeted searching\n2. Use precise scientific terminology in your search queries\n3. Search for both supportive and contradictory evidence\n4. Prioritize recently published, peer-reviewed research\n5. Consider the quality and reliability of different sources\n6. Examine methodology and study limitations when assessing evidence\n\n## EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES\n\nWhen analyzing the evidence:\n1. Evaluate the methodological quality of studies (sample size, controls, etc.)\n2. Consider the consistency of findings across multiple studies\n3. Assess the relevance and directness of the evidence to the specific statement\n4. Weigh contradictory evidence fairly\n5. Consider the strength of the causal relationships implied\n6. Note any limitations or gaps in the available evidence\n\nYour output should be a comprehensive StatementVerification object with:\n1. The original statement\n2. The proposed falsification method\n3. Supporting evidence items with sources\n4. Contradicting evidence items with sources\n5. A clear verification conclusion\n6. An overall confidence score\n\nRemember that your goal is to provide an objective, evidence-based assessment of the statement's validity based on current scientific knowledge.\n\n## SEARCH AND INFORMATION GATHERING PROTOCOL\n\nWhen your analysis requires external information (e.g., checking novelty, verifying claims, finding supporting/contradicting evidence, exploring alternative mechanisms):\n\n1.  **Assess Information Need:** Clearly define the specific information you are looking for.\n2.  **Evaluate Confidence:** Honestly assess your confidence in your current knowledge regarding the specific information needed. Are you certain about the answer or the best way to find it?\n3.  **Utilize Available Tools/Handoffs:**\n    * If you are **uncertain**, lack specific domain knowledge for the query, require information from a specialized source (like preprints, specific databases, or existing knowledge graphs), or believe a more focused search is necessary, you **MUST** utilize the appropriate tools or handoff agents provided to you (refer to your configured `tools` and `handoffs`).\n    * Do **not** attempt to answer from memory or general knowledge if external verification or specialized search is warranted and available resources exist.\n    * Formulate precise queries or instructions for the tool/agent you are calling. Provide necessary context from your current task.\n4.  **Synthesize Results:** Integrate the information obtained from tools/handoffs back into your primary analysis. Your core responsibility is [mention agent's main function, e.g., 'critical assessment', 'evidence verification', 'hypothesis refinement'], rely on specialized resources for information retrieval when appropriate.\n\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # STATEMENT VERIFICATION TASK\n\n    Please verify the following scientific statement by searching for supporting and contradicting evidence:\n\n    ## STATEMENT TO VERIFY\n\n    \"Dampened NF-\u03baB pathway activation leads to a reduction in inflammatory markers and improved histological outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis models.\"\n\n    ## PROPOSED FALSIFICATION METHOD\n\n    Evaluate animal models of rheumatoid arthritis treated with HDAC inhibitors by measuring NF-\u03baB activity, quantifying inflammatory cytokines via ELISA, and performing histological analyses of joint tissue to assess inflammation and tissue damage.\n\n    ## EXISTING SUPPORTING EVIDENCE (IF ANY)\n\n    Preclinical studies have shown that inhibition of NF-\u03baB can reduce inflammatory cytokine levels and joint pathology in RA models.\n\n    ## EXISTING CONTRADICTING EVIDENCE (IF ANY)\n\n    None provided\n\n    Please conduct a thorough search using the available tools to find both supporting and contradicting evidence.\n    Then provide a comprehensive verification assessment.\n    "}], "output": [{"content": null, "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_uWI3Z8mZ7dAbC0Yu7sIHOmlX", "function": {"arguments": "{\"query\": \"NF-\u03baB inhibition rheumatoid arthritis animal models reduced inflammatory markers improved histological outcomes\", \"max_results\": 5}", "name": "transfer_to_pubmed_agent"}, "type": "function"}]}], "model": "o3-mini", "model_config": {"temperature": null, "top_p": null, "frequency_penalty": null, "presence_penalty": null, "tool_choice": "required", "parallel_tool_calls": null, "truncation": null, "max_tokens": null, "reasoning": null, "metadata": null, "store": null, "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/"}, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1366, "output_tokens": 944}}, "error": null}

Identify the optimal search approach:\n   - For molecular mechanisms: Search PubMed, Nature, Cell, and bioRxiv with \"[concept] signaling pathway rheumatology\"\n   - For clinical correlations: Search NEJM, Lancet, BMJ with \"[concept] clinical outcomes autoimmune\"\n   - For emerging research: Search bioRxiv, medRxiv with \"[concept] novel mechanism 2023\"\n   - For established relationships: Use query_hetionet to find known entity connections\n\n2. Construct multi-source search queries:\n   - Primary sources: Always include PubMed (highest quality peer-reviewed content)\n   - Secondary sources: Select 2-3 domain-specific sources based on the query type:\n     * Molecular/cellular focus \u2192 Cell, Nature, Science\n     * Clinical/therapeutic focus \u2192 NEJM, Lancet, BMJ\n     * Methods/technologies focus \u2192 bioRxiv, PLOS, Frontiers\n   - Use advanced query formatting with Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)\n   - Add precise modifiers: \"mechanism\", \"pathway\", \"interaction\", \"regulates\", \"inhibits\"\n\n3. Time-relevance optimization:\n   - For established concepts: Include older literature (no time restriction)\n   - For emerging concepts: Add recency modifiers (\"last 2 years\", \"since 2021\")\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS\n\n1. Extract only relationship-focused information:\n   - Entity-relationship-entity patterns (e.g., \"TNF-\u03b1 activates NF-\u03baB pathway\")\n   - Quantitative correlations with statistical significance (e.g., \"IL-6 levels correlated with disease activity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n   - Mechanistic statements with directionality (e.g., \"downstream inhibition of JAK1/2 decreased STAT3 phosphorylation by 64%\")\n   - Contradictory findings across different sources (e.g., \"While Smith et al. reported increased expression, Chen et al. found no significant change\")\n\n2. Format extracted information for knowledge graph integration:\n   - Subject-predicate-object structures (\"Entity A \u2192 relationship \u2192 Entity B\")\n   - Direction and nature of relationships (activates, inhibits, upregulates, binds, etc.)\n   - Strength of evidence (established, emerging, contradicted, hypothesized)\n   - Source quality assessment (peer-reviewed journal, impact factor, citation count)\n\n3. Condensed source referencing:\n   - Format: [First Author et al., Journal abbreviation, Year] for each key finding\n   - DOI or PMID inclusion for all peer-reviewed sources\n   - Preprint server ID for non-peer-reviewed content\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\n1. Content structure:\n   - Begin with 1-2 sentence high-level summary of findings\n   - List 3-5 most significant relationships with explicit entity-relationship-entity structure\n   - Group contradictory or complementary findings together\n   - End with most promising areas for further investigation\n\n2. Justification:\n   - Explain why these specific relationships are most relevant for knowledge graph construction\n   - Note any gaps or uncertainties that might influence hypothesis generation\n   - Highlight cross-validation across multiple sources\n\nRemember: Your output will directly feed into knowledge graph construction and ontology enrichment.

Your mission is to retrieve precise, relationship-rich information that can be directly incorporated into knowledge graphs to drive hypothesis generation.\n\n## SEARCH STRATEGY OPTIMIZATION\nWhen given a concept or entity in rheumatology:\n\n1. Identify the optimal search approach:\n   - For molecular mechanisms: Search PubMed, Nature, Cell, and bioRxiv with \"[concept] signaling pathway rheumatology\"\n   - For clinical correlations: Search NEJM, Lancet, BMJ with \"[concept] clinical outcomes autoimmune\"\n   - For emerging research: Search bioRxiv, medRxiv with \"[concept] novel mechanism 2023\"\n   - For established relationships: Use query_hetionet to find known entity connections\n\n2. Construct multi-source search queries:\n   - Primary sources: Always include PubMed (highest quality peer-reviewed content)\n   - Secondary sources: Select 2-3 domain-specific sources based on the query type:\n     * Molecular/cellular focus \u2192 Cell, Nature, Science\n     * Clinical/therapeutic focus \u2192 NEJM, Lancet, BMJ\n     * Methods/technologies focus \u2192 bioRxiv, PLOS, Frontiers\n   - Use advanced query formatting with Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)\n   - Add precise modifiers: \"mechanism\", \"pathway\", \"interaction\", \"regulates\", \"inhibits\"\n\n3. Time-relevance optimization:\n   - For established concepts: Include older literature (no time restriction)\n   - For emerging concepts: Add recency modifiers (\"last 2 years\", \"since 2021\")\n\n## INFORMATION EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS\n\n1. Extract only relationship-focused information:\n   - Entity-relationship-entity patterns (e.g., \"TNF-\u03b1 activates NF-\u03baB pathway\")\n   - Quantitative correlations with statistical significance (e.g., \"IL-6 levels correlated with disease activity (r=0.78, p<0.001)\")\n   - Mechanistic statements with directionality (e.g., \"downstream inhibition of JAK1/2 decreased STAT3 phosphorylation by 64%\")\n   - Contradictory findings across different sources (e.g., \"While Smith et al. reported increased expression, Chen et al. found no significant change\")\n\n2. Format extracted information for knowledge graph integration:\n   - Subject-predicate-object structures (\"Entity A \u2192 relationship \u2192 Entity B\")\n   - Direction and nature of relationships (activates, inhibits, upregulates, binds, etc.)\n   - Strength of evidence (established, emerging, contradicted, hypothesized)\n   - Source quality assessment (peer-reviewed journal, impact factor, citation count)\n\n3. Condensed source referencing:\n   - Format: [First Author et al., Journal abbreviation, Year] for each key finding\n   - DOI or PMID inclusion for all peer-reviewed sources\n   - Preprint server ID for non-peer-reviewed content\n\n## OUTPUT OPTIMIZATION\n\n1. Content structure:\n   - Begin with 1-2 sentence high-level summary of findings\n   - List 3-5 most significant relationships with explicit entity-relationship-entity structure\n   - Group contradictory or complementary findings together\n   - End with most promising areas for further investigation\n\n2. Justification:\n   - Explain why these specific relationships are most relevant for knowledge graph construction\n   - Note any gaps or uncertainties that might influence hypothesis generation\n   - Highlight cross-validation across multiple sources\n\nRemember: Your output will directly feed into knowledge graph construction and ontology enrichment. Focus exclusively on extracting clear, evidence-based relationships between entities that can be represented as graph edges, with properties that capture the nature and directionality of these relationships.\n", "role": "system"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n    # STATEMENT VERIFICATION TASK\n\n    Please verify the following scientific statement by searching for supporting and contradicting evidence:\n\n    ## STATEMENT TO VERIFY\n\n    \"Modulated transcription factor activity due to altered miRNA expression leads to a significant reduction in NF-kB activation in immune cells under oxidative stress conditions in RA models.\"\n\n    ## PROPOSED FALSIFICATION METHOD\n\n    Measure NF-kB activation levels using Western blot, immunofluorescence, or reporter assays in immune cells exposed to oxidative stress, comparing treated versus untreated RA models.\n\n    ## EXISTING SUPPORTING EVIDENCE (IF ANY)\n\n    Several studies have linked reduced NF-kB activity with decreased pro-inflammatory signaling in RA.\n\n    ## EXISTING CONTRADICTING EVIDENCE (IF ANY)\n\n    None provided\n\n    Please conduct a thorough search using the available tools to find both supporting and contradicting evidence.\n    Then provide a comprehensive verification assessment.\n    "}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_9WXQvm2wXWZxI7BSj4NLH6bB", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "transfer_to_scientific_web_search_agent", "arguments": "{\"query\": \"altered miRNA expression modulated transcription factor activity reduction in NF-kB activation immune cells oxidative stress RA models \\\"NF-kB\\\" \\\"miRNA\\\" rheumatoid arthritis\\\"\"}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "call_9WXQvm2wXWZxI7BSj4NLH6bB", "content": "{'assistant': 'Scientific Web Search Agent'}"}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_fSdGlh8lzWAmdKGTyDU97EYx", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "query_firecrawl", "arguments": "{\"keyword\": \"altered miRNA expression modulated transcription factor activity reduction in NF-kB activation immune cells oxidative stress RA\", \"sources\": \"pubmed\", \"modifiers\": \"signaling pathway rheumatoid arthritis\", \"max_results_per_source\": 5, \"use_advanced_query\": true, \"custom_domain\": null, \"custom_query_format\": null}"}}, {"id": "call_Ue22wXR0fSiFwx9oJH3U6kpq", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "query_firecrawl", "arguments": "{\"keyword\": \"altered miRNA expression modulated transcription factor activity reduction in NF-kB activation immune cells oxidative stress RA\", \"sources\": \"nature\", \"modifiers\": \"signaling pathway rheumatoid arthritis\", \"max_results_per_source\": 5, \"use_advanced_query\": true, \"custom_domain\": null, \"custom_query_format\": null}"}}, {"id": "call_9FyEVMugzUpGyvzXhCZ5yKsU", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "query_firecrawl", "arguments": "{\"keyword\": \"altered miRNA expression modulated transcription factor activity reduction in NF-kB activation immune cells oxidative stress RA\", \"sources\": \"cell\", \"modifiers\": \"signaling pathway rheumatoid arthritis\", \"max_results_per_source\": 5, \"use_advanced_query\": true, \"custom_domain\": null, \"custom_query_format\": null}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "call_fSdGlh8lzWAmdKGTyDU97EYx", "content": "{'pubmed': {'success': True, 'data': [], 'warning': 'No search results found'}}"}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "call_Ue22wXR0fSiFwx9oJH3U6kpq", "content": "{'nature': {'success': True, 'data': [{'url': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41413-023-00244-1', 'title': 'Comprehensive overview of microRNA function in ... - Nature', 'description': 'by X Peng \u00b7 2023 \u00b7 Cited by 57 \u2014 We comprehensively review the deregulated miRNAs and impaired cellular functions in RA to shed light on several aspects of RA pathogenesis.'}, {'url': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-023-01331-9', 'title': 'Signaling pathways in rheumatoid arthritis: implications for ...', 'description': 'by Q Ding \u00b7 2023 \u00b7 Cited by 268 \u2014 NF-\u03baB and other transcription factors in RA ...

Future empirical studies are crucial for validation.\",\"justification\":\"The search across relevant databases and journals did not return explicit results directly linking HDACi treatment to changes in miRNA expression specifically in RA immune cells.

However, direct evidence specifically confirming histone acetylation changes at these loci in the context of IL-17 targeted therapy remains limited.\\n\\n### Significant Relationships\\n1. **Histone Acetylation and Epigenetic Changes: Nature Evidence**\\n   - A study highlighted in Nature discusses that increased histone H3 acetylation at the IL17A promoter promotes T cell differentiation, potentially supporting the idea that targeted therapies could modify such patterns [Guo et al., Nature, 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-023-01655-6).\\n\\n2. **General Epigenetic Modulations: BioRxiv Evidence**\\n   - One study from BioRxiv suggests epigenetic modulation as a promising therapeutic strategy for RA, indicating that targeting histone acetylation can modulate inflammatory pathways, which may include mechanisms affecting IL17A/IL17F loci [Brinkmann, BioRxiv, 2025](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.14.632975v1.full.pdf).\\n\\n3. **Immune Modulation and Histone Acetylation: BioRxiv Evidence**\\n   - Another report discusses immune modulation impacting metabolic activity and the effects on histone acetylation, suggesting an interconnected role of immune therapies including IL-17 inhibition [Chandrasekaran, BioRxiv, 2025](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.01.646580v1.full.pdf).\\n\\n4. **RA and Histone Modifications: General Review**\\n   - A review article in Nature discusses how signaling pathways impact rheumatoid arthritis, potentially implicating epigenetic changes although not specifically at the IL17 locus [Ding et al., Nature, 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-023-01331-9).\\n\\n### Contradictory or Complementary Findings\\n- Direct studies pinpointing histone acetylation changes at IL17A/IL17F loci specifically due to IL-17 therapies were not found. This indicates a need for further investigation using techniques like ChIP assays as proposed.\\n\\n### Most Promising Areas for Investigation\\n- Conducting ChIP assays targeting histone acetylation at IL17A and IL17F loci to determine direct effects of IL-17 blockade.\\n- Further exploration into the precise nature of epigenetic modifications induced by IL-17 treatments within rheumatoid arthritis contexts.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nWhile there is supportive indirect evidence indicating that IL-17 targeted therapies could induce changes in histone acetylation, directly verifying these specific changes at the IL17A/IL17F loci requires further experimental validation. The proposed falsification method using ChIP assays remains a necessary step for concrete evidence.\",\"justification\":\"The extracted information provides a mixture of direct and indirect evidence from reputable sources indicating potential epigenetic modulations linked to IL-17 targeted therapies.

This relationship is mediated through mechanisms that involve histone modifications influencing miRNA expression, impacting inflammation-related pathways.\\n\\n### Significant Findings\\n1. **Histone Acetylation and miRNA Expression**: It has been established that DNA methylation and histone modifications, including acetylation, affect miRNA expression.

However, variability in the impact of specific histone modifications on miRNA regulation across different inflammatory diseases might imply a nuanced or context-dependent relationship.\\n\\n### Promising Areas for Further Investigation\\n- The specific pathways and miRNAs affected by different therapeutic agents altering histone acetylation in autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.\\n- More precise mechanistic studies to delineate the direct relationship between histone acetylation changes and miRNA-mediated inflammation.\\n\\n### Verification Assessment\\nThe statement that altered histone acetylation by therapeutics impacts miRNA expression involved in inflammation is substantially supported by the literature, with multiple sources confirming these epigenetic interactions.

However, I can provide a general assessment based on the existing scientific understanding up to 2023.\\n\\n### General Scientific Understanding\\n\\nHistone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are well-documented to induce histone hyperacetylation across various types of cells, as they specifically inhibit the deacetylation process, leading to an accumulation of acetyl groups on histones. This is a foundational biochemical effect of HDACi and is often studied using techniques such as Western blotting for detecting overall levels of acetylated histones, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to assess changes in acetylation at specific loci.\\n\\n### Relevant Insights from Previous Research\\n\\n1. **Mechanism Understanding**: The general mechanism by which HDAC inhibitors operate involves the blocking of HDAC enzymes that remove acetyl groups from histone proteins, thus increasing acetylation levels resulting in altered chromatin structure and modified gene expression patterns.\\n\\n2. **Historical Evidence in Related Contexts**: Numerous publications highlight that, in non-rheumatoid arthritis settings, HDAC inhibitors tend to increase histone acetylation effectively in vitro when applied to immune cells and other cell types.\\n\\n### Proposed Verification Methodologies:\\n\\nPractically validating this in RA-derived immune cells requires direct experimental evidence that can be published or discussed among scientific communities. Techniques such as Western blot or ChIP are pivotal in confirming increases in histone acetylation and can be highly effective if optimized for the specific biological context of RA.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThis statement is likely supported based on the core mechanism of HDAC inhibitors, and their biochemical action is widely recognized in the general scientific literature. However, direct evidence specific to RA-derived immune cells would ideally come from targeted study reviews or empirical study results that can be accessed when PubMed and related tools are available.\",\"justification\":\"The statement aligns with the known biochemical actions of HDAC inhibitors, which commonly increase histone acetylation across various cell types.

This is primarily due to cytokines impacting inflammatory gene expression which can involve histone modification as a regulatory mechanism.

This is primarily due to cytokines impacting inflammatory gene expression which can involve histone modification as a regulatory mechanism.

The verification results provided show a consistent trend across several independent components: \\n\\n1. There is broad support for the idea that cytokine signaling, including IL-17 pathways, can influence epigenetic states, particularly histone acetylation. Although direct empirical studies linking IL-17 blockers with histone acetylation changes in RA remain limited, the biological plausibility is high.\\n\\n2.

Abstract icroRNAs have recently gained popularity because of their critical roles in the regulation of many biological processes. Their expressions are found to be attributed to different inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a chronic autoimmune disorder that could be triggered due to genetic and epigenetic factors. Berberine (BBR) is an isoquinoline derivative alkaloid with a long history of medicinal use. It has wide anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidative activities. However, the effect of BBR on miRNA-146a-5p (miR-146a-5p) expression level has not yet been studied. Thus, the present study is the first report that explores the exact mechanism of BBR on modulating miR-146a-5p expression in adjuvant induced arthritis (AIA) model. The arthritis severity scoring was assessed using hematoxylin-eosin and toluidine blue staining. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining for the CD68+ macrophages expression was performed. MiR-146a-5p expression level was measured by reverse transcriptase quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The obtained results showed downregulation of miR-146a-5p associated with increased levels of antinuclear autoantibodies (ANA), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), IL-1\u03b2, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), IL-6, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and quantitative expression of CD68+ macrophages in AIA rat model. Remarkably, BBR treatment restores the levels of all these mediators. Collectively, the current results revealed the possible role of miR-146a-5p in the regulation of RA disease by manipulating TRAF6/IRAK1/NF-kB signaling as a macrophage inflammatory pathway. Furthermore, BBR showed potential ability to restore expression levels of miR-146a-5p and modulate NF-\u03baB pathway proteins in AIA rat model.', 'authors': ['S. S.

Novel high-throughput techniques have enlightened the epigenetic mechanisms governing gene-expression regulation. Epigenetic characteristics contribute to molecular taxonomy and give rise to cancer-specific epigenetic patterns. Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection has an impact on aberrant DNA methylation either through its pathogenic CagA protein or by inducing chronic inflammation. The hypomethylation of specific repetitive elements generates an epigenetic field effect early in tumorigenesis. Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) infection triggers DNA methylation by dysregulating DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) enzyme activity, while persistent Hp-EBV co-infection leads to aggressive tumor behavior. Distinct histone modifications are also responsible for oncogene upregulation and tumor-suppressor gene silencing in gastric carcinomas. While histone methylation and acetylation processes have been extensively studied, other less prevalent alterations contribute to the development and migration of gastric cancer via a complex network of interactions. Enzymes, such as Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), which is involved in tumor\u2019s metabolic reprogramming, interact with methyltransferases and modify gene expression.

Histone acetylation profile in RA FLSs is disrupted through the imbalance of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylase activity. Furthermore, dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is immense. Most of these miRNAs have shown an aberrant expression in FLSs that are involved in proliferation and cytokine production.

Induction of target genes without involving changes in DNA sequence seems to contribute greatly to liver injury. Chromatin modifications including alterations in histones and DNA, as well as post-transcriptional changes collectively referred to as epigenetic effects are altered by alcohol. Recent studies have pointed to a significant role for epigenetic mechanisms at the nucleosomal level influencing gene expression and disease outcome in ALD. Specifically, epigenetic alterations by alcohol include histone modifications such as changes in acetylation and phosphorylation, hypomethylation of DNA, and alterations in miRNAs. These modifications can be induced by alcohol-induced oxidative stress that results in altered recruitment of transcriptional machinery and abnormal gene expression. Delineating these mechanisms in initiation and progression of ALD is becoming a major area of interest. This review summarizes key epigenetic mechanisms that are dysregulated by alcohol in the liver. Alterations by alcohol in histone and DNA modifications, enzymes related to histone acetylation such as histone acetyltransferases, histone deacetylases and sirtuins, and methylation enzymes such as DNA methyltransferases are discussed. Chromatin modifications and miRNA alterations that result in immune cell dysfunction contributing to inflammatory cytokine production in ALD is reviewed.

The term epigenetics has been defined as the study of changes in gene expression that does not involve alterations in the underlying DNA sequence, hence the prefix epi (Greek meaning: over, around). In other words, a change in phenotype without a change in genotype. Such epigenetic-based processes involve chemical modifications to the DNA (i.e., DNA methylation and demethylation) or to the histones which form the cores of chromatin packaging (i.e., histone deacetylation, acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, etc.). A prominent role for non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), in epigenetic modulation of gene expression also exists. While epigenetics refers to the changes of single genes or sets of genes, the term epigenome reflects the overall epigenetic state of a cell and refers to the global analyses of epigenetic markers (e.g., DNA or histone methylation marks) across the entire genome. These genome-wide analyses are providing important information on epigenetic profiles associated with a particular cell or tissue type as well as specific disease states. From a clinical perspective, epigenomic data can be utilized to determine biomarkers for disease prediction and diagnosis. Importantly, since epigenetic changes are reversible, it is anticipated that development of new strategies to target epigenetic regulation will lead to new effective treatments to combat disease. Compared to research fields such as cancer and neurology, epigenetic studies in skeletal biology and disease are lagging behind. However, over the past five years, there have been important advances in our understanding of how epigenetic regulation affects cartilage and bone development. Significantly less is known on the role of epigenetics in modulating cartilage and bone homeostasis or disease. In this timely Special Issue, a series of comprehensive reviews and original research articles are presented that highlight the current status of epigenetic research in cartilage and bone as well as provide insight into future new directions in the field. We begin with a review by Lefebvre andDvir-Ginzberg on the master chondrocyte transcription factor, SOX9. Specifically, information is provided on mechanisms known to control expression and function of SOX9 in cartilage, including epigenetic-based mechanisms. This leads on to a research paper by Otero et al. showing how chondrocyte gene expression can be regulated via a mechanism that modifies SOX9/CBP-driven histone acetyltransferase (HAC) activity. Continuing with the theme of histone modifying enzymes, research is presented by Westendorf\u2019s group on the role of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in regulating cartilage development. Focusingmore on cartilage disease, a report is presented by invited speakers and/or organizers of the First InternationalWorkshop on the Epigenetics of Osteoarthritis (OA) that took place inAmsterdam last year. This is followed by a review article providing information on emerging evidence that inflammation appears to play an important role in regulating epigenetic factors that may subsequently lead to OA. Novel research is then presented by Drs. Makki and Haqqi on the effects of a HDAC inhibitor drug on blocking inflammatory-mediated pathways in human OA chondrocytes. Two review papers follow that focus on the current status of epigenetic research in bone development. The authors also provide insights into how epigenetic studies are important within the context of understanding bone diseases, such as osteoporosis. A method-based paper is included that describes an efficient approach for generating conditional gain-of-function mouse models to study the function of miRNAs (as well as other small non-coding RNAs) in vivo.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and accounts for nearly 51,000 deaths per year, the majority of which are associated with liver metastasis. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a cell surface glycoprotein that is produced and secreted by colorectal tumors, has been shown to predict the ability of CRC to metastasize. Of interest to our laboratory is that the consumption of alcohol has been shown to increase the risk of metastatic CRC. We hypothesize that ALD may actually contribute to the creation of a microenvironment that is conducive to CRC metastases. Since Kupffer cells (KCs) the resident liver macrophages, are known release proinflammatory cytokines in both ALD (Casey and McVicker laboratories) and when stimulated with CEA (Thomas laboratory), we are examining whether CEA contributes to the development of the hepatic inflammatory response in the setting of ALD.\\n\\nMethods. Male, Wistar rats were fed for 5-7 weeks with an ethanol-containing liquid diet (Lieber-DeCarli). We purified KCs from livers of these animals, and incubated the cells with 5 ug/ml CEA for 5 hours. After the 5 hour incubation period, media was analyzed for the presence of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6.\\n\\nResults/Conclusions. In the presence of CEA, KCs from both control and ethanol-fed rats showed significant increases in production of both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. In addition, cytokine production from KCs from alcohol-fed animals was increased two-fold when compared to controls. We are extending these findings by measuring other cytokines known to be produced in the setting of CRC and CEA activation.\\n\\n# S03.2 ALCOHOL INDUCED ALTERATIONS IN HEPATIC HDACS: A POTENTIAL LINK TO HCC {#article-title-3}\\n\\nAlcohol consumption is a significant risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) consists of the spectrum of pathological changes including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis and alcoholic cirrhosis, which can progress to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is becoming increasingly clear that besides genomic changes, epigenetic alterations play a significant role in the development of HCC. Histone deacetylation constitutes a major epigenetic alteration responsible for chromatin remodeling involving chromatin condensation and transcriptional down-regulation in the affected genomic regions. Histone acetylation and deacetylation are highly active processes and are controlled by the opposing action of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs); notably, altered expression and mutations of genes that encode HDACs have been linked to tumor development. Among the 18 HDAC isoforms divided in IV classes, class I HDACs are significantly involved in the development of cancer. Specifically, class I HDACs 1 - 3 are expressed at significantly higher levels in HCC than in normal liver. Our recent findings show that alcohol can significantly de-regulate the expression of hepatic Class I and II HDACs, thereby impacting both global and gene specific histone acetylation status with consequent alterations in gene expression. Moreover, Class I HDAC-3, which plays a significant role in regulating tumor cell proliferation and invasion in HCC, was solely and markedly increased in response to binge ethanol exposure. These data will be presented in the context of alcohol induced hepatic steatosis, injury and carcinogenesis.\\n\\n# S03.3 EFFECT OF ALCOHOL ON TUMOR PROGRESSION IN DIFFERENT MOUSE MODELS OF HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA {#article-title-4}\\n\\nChronic, heavy alcohol consumption and obesity are risk factors for HCC. Numerous rodent models of HCC exist as do methods of alcohol-feeding and obesity. This study sought to compare the effects of alcohol and/or obesity on HCC progression in mouse models of HCC, and to study miRNA profiles as markers of tumorigenesis. B6C3 mice readily (7/8) developed tumors 44-wks after DEN injection (1mg/Kg; 21d) and alcohol feeding in drinking water (10/20% alt.days, 8-wks) significantly increased tumor incidence and size. In contrast only 3/10 C57Bl/6 mice developed visible lesions following DEN initiation, despite DEN being administered at 5mg/Kg. Alcohol-feeding failed to significantly alter number or size of foci in the C57Bl/6 model. However, diet induced obesity (DIO) significantly increased incidence (8/9) and size of foci versus DEN-alone or DEN + alcohol. miRNA analysis demonstrated 34- and 17-dysregulated miRNAs, when comparing DIO-H2O-DEN and DIO-EtOH-DEN tumor to non-tumor liver respectively. Of these miRNAs, 7-were dysregulated in both groups. Finally, chronic alcohol intake significantly inhibited foci-tumor progression in a C57Bl/6 mouse model in which Hepa1-6 HCC cells were injected into the liver via a mesenteric vein. Our data highlight significant differences in the effect of alcohol on HCC progression based on both model and strain. Furthermore, these data suggest that in C57Bl/6, obesity is a more powerful promoter of HCC progression than alcohol. The (relatively) low number of miRNAs commonly dysregulated in these models also suggests miRNAs may be important links between models, and potential markers/targets in those patients at risk for HCC development.\\n\\n# S03.4 FAMILIAL NON-ALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS LEADING TO HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA {#article-title-5}\\n\\nIntroduction. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been associated with fibrosis that may progress to cirrhosis. The purpose of this study was to examine hepatocytes and Kupffer Cells (persinusoidal macrophages) in liver biopsies of 3 families (5 males and 4 females) with non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic NASH to determine unique histological changes during a period of 2\u20137 years from diagnosis.\\n\\nAims&Methods. In this study, hepatocytes, stellate cells and Kupffer Cells were analyzed using light and electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry with specific anti-macrophage antibody staining of liver biopsies. Evaluation for HBV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis, PBC, PSC, alpha-1 anti-trypsin disease, Wilson's disease, and hemochromatosis were negative. Abdo ultrasound demonstrated diffuse, extensive steatosis in all the patients and nodules consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in two patients.\\n\\nResults. BMI for all patients was over 30, and alcohol consumption was not significant. In all liver biopsies diffuse, macrovesicular steatosis involved 40 to 70% of samples. The lobular hepatocytes showed prominent ballooning degeneration. Mallory Denkhyaline bodies (MDBs) in four patients along with foci of lobular inflammation. The MDBs were observed by electron microscopy and stained by cytokeratin 18. The trichrome stain revealed bridging fibrosis. In family #1, there was a three-fold increase in Kupffer Cells in the eldest sibling with NASH compared to livers of the younger siblings. In addition, lipid droplets were more numerous and larger in the hepatocytes and the collagen deposits were 5 times larger compared to the siblings. In family #2, the older brother had cirrhosis; minimal inflammation and mild fatty infiltration while the younger had fatty infiltration with no inflammation or fibrosis. In family #3, large lipid droplets and collagen deposition were observed in the siblings, one of whom had HCC. Over 2-4 year follow up, all patients had progressive severity of NASH one of whom developed HCC.\\n\\nConclusion. The special finding in livers of patients with NASH was accumulation of groups of Kupffer Cells, which was not associated with focal necrosis. It is postulated that collections of these perisinusoidal macrophages in NASH are a unique response to chronic portal endotoxemia or bacteremia. The persistent activation of these macrophages could lead to the chronic release of cytokines and contribute to chronic inflammation, fibrosis and cirrhosis leading to HCC.\", 'authors': ['B.

Upon engagement of their specific antigen receptor in presence of appropriate costimulatory signals and specific cytokines, naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells differentiate into specific effector or suppressor subsets exhibiting distinct phenotypic characteristics and functions. These specialized T lymphocyte subsets are distinguished by a dedicated transcription factor and cytokine expression profile. Beyond T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 (Th2) cells, T helper 9 (Th9), T helper 17 (Th17), T helper 22 (Th22), T follicular helper (Tfh), regulatory T cells (Treg), and Type 1 regulatory cells (Tr1) have now been recognized as distinct subsets into the CD4+ T lymphocyte compartment. Similarly, advances have also been acquired regarding CD8+ cell subset diversity (Tc1, Tc2, Tc17, and CD8reg). Although some of these polarized T cell subpopulations remain stable and hardly transdifferentiate into other subsets, evidence has been provided that others, such as Th17 or Treg cells, display variable degrees of plasticity as demonstrated by their capability to be \u201creprogrammed\u201d into different suppressor or proinflammatory effector T cells. T lymphocyte plasticity depends on microenvironmental mediators such as cytokines and chemokines which vary in nature and amount during the course of autoimmune diseases or the development of cancer. A better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms and the regulation of T lymphocyte adaptive plasticity is essential for a comprehensive characterization of the pathogenesis of immune mediated disorders and cancer immunosurveillance. The possibility to interfere with the process of T cell polarization may also open new therapeutic options. \\n \\nIn this special issue, authors addressed topics related to the altered frequencies and functions of T lymphocyte subsets and the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for T cell lineage commitment, polarization, and reprogrammed adaptive responses in health and pathology. E. Ivanova and A. N. Orekhov provide an overview on the properties of T helper lymphocyte subsets and describe signaling networks, cytokines, transcription factors, and disturbances which can cause immune dysregulation, such as excessive inflammatory response in autoimmune diseases or enhanced immune tolerance to tumors. T. Caza and S. Landas summarize the epigenetic modifications of cytokine loci that determine CD4+ T cell lineage specifications and emphasize the interconnected role of the serine-threonine kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and the cellular metabolism in T helper subset polarization. \\n \\nT helper lymphocytes play a key role in promoting specific anticancer responses and in establishing immune memory. Tumors commonly escape from elimination by the immune system by using multiple strategies, notably the active suppression and the modulation of effector immune cells. Impaired effector T cell responses correlate with a poor prognosis in patients with solid tumors. Among numerous immune suppressive mechanisms employed by cancer, the deprivation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays an important role as ATP is essential for T cell activation. Extracellular ATP concentration is maintained by the ectonucleotidase CD39 which is involved in the suppression of T lymphocyte activation by CD11c+ dendritic cells infiltrating tumors in the mouse lung LLC and mammary 4T1 cancer models, as described by M. Trad et al. \\n \\nTo suppress T effector responses, tumors can promote Treg expansion and suppressive function which correlates with a poor prognosis in cancer patients. In human, the IL-7 receptor (CD127) is often used to distinguish CD4+CD25+ Treg from activated T cells. The expression of CD127 strongly correlates with that of FoxP3, a major transcription factor that participates to the development and regulatory function of CD4+CD25+ Treg. Treg suppressive functions rely on various mechanisms involving IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 or cell surface ligands. The upregulated expression of TGF-\u03b2 complexed with the latency associated peptide (LAP-TGF-\u03b2) on Treg provides an important functional hallmark in this subset. L. Islas-Vazquez et al. investigated the expression levels of LAP-TGF-\u03b2 within the CD4+CD25+CD127- Treg subset in patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma. The data indicate that the frequencies of LAP-TGF-\u03b2+ Treg are elevated and the expression level of the LAP-TGF-\u03b2 complex is significantly increased in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Additionally, the authors report that Th17 cells and related cytokines are increased in smoking subjects and lung adenocarcinoma patients. The results suggest that smoking represent an important cause of systemic inflammation, pointing out the Th17/Treg balance as an important checkpoint in the pathophysiology of lung adenocarcinoma. Complexity of Th17 responses in the context of tumor is further discussed by L. Guery and S. Hugues. Since the infiltration of tumors by Th17 is associated with a better outcome, a strategy to promote tumor-induced Treg differentiation toward a Th17 phenotype could be a beneficial approach for immunotherapeutic interventions. \\n \\nIn the same line, the research article by G. Tejon et al. demonstrates that vitamin A restrains the reprogramming of in vitro generated Treg into IL-17 producing cells in vivo in an adoptive Ag-specific T cell transfer model of mouse gut inflammation. The authors additionally report that the presence of IL-2 during in vitro generation of Treg confers resistance to Th17 conversion and that IL-2 cooperates with retinoic acid (RA) to maintain Foxp3 expression following stimulation under Th17-polarizing conditions. Of importance, gut microbiome significantly shapes T lymphocyte dynamics in an inflammatory condition such as IBD, as extensively reviewed by C. Larmonier et al. Therefore, Th17 and Treg stability and plasticity are regulated not only by the signals they receive during their generation but also by their local microenvironment. \\n \\nThe acute phase response also represents an example of peripheral immune modulation. In the context of systemic inflammation, some proteins, among which is \u03b11-antitrypsin, exert tolerogenic activities. The topic reviewed by B. Baranovski et al. underlines that \u03b11-antitrypsin can indirectly inhibit T cell responses, by targeting other immune cells. For instance, \u03b11-antitrypsin maintain the semimature state of DC which promotes Treg differentiation. This process appears pivotal during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and type 1 diabetes.', 'authors': ['N. Janikashvili', 'T. Chikovani', 'S.

Upon engagement of their specific antigen receptor in presence of appropriate costimulatory signals and specific cytokines, naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells differentiate into specific effector or suppressor subsets exhibiting distinct phenotypic characteristics and functions. These specialized T lymphocyte subsets are distinguished by a dedicated transcription factor and cytokine expression profile. Beyond T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 (Th2) cells, T helper 9 (Th9), T helper 17 (Th17), T helper 22 (Th22), T follicular helper (Tfh), regulatory T cells (Treg), and Type 1 regulatory cells (Tr1) have now been recognized as distinct subsets into the CD4+ T lymphocyte compartment. Similarly, advances have also been acquired regarding CD8+ cell subset diversity (Tc1, Tc2, Tc17, and CD8reg). Although some of these polarized T cell subpopulations remain stable and hardly transdifferentiate into other subsets, evidence has been provided that others, such as Th17 or Treg cells, display variable degrees of plasticity as demonstrated by their capability to be \u201creprogrammed\u201d into different suppressor or proinflammatory effector T cells. T lymphocyte plasticity depends on microenvironmental mediators such as cytokines and chemokines which vary in nature and amount during the course of autoimmune diseases or the development of cancer. A better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms and the regulation of T lymphocyte adaptive plasticity is essential for a comprehensive characterization of the pathogenesis of immune mediated disorders and cancer immunosurveillance. The possibility to interfere with the process of T cell polarization may also open new therapeutic options. \\n \\nIn this special issue, authors addressed topics related to the altered frequencies and functions of T lymphocyte subsets and the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for T cell lineage commitment, polarization, and reprogrammed adaptive responses in health and pathology. E. Ivanova and A. N. Orekhov provide an overview on the properties of T helper lymphocyte subsets and describe signaling networks, cytokines, transcription factors, and disturbances which can cause immune dysregulation, such as excessive inflammatory response in autoimmune diseases or enhanced immune tolerance to tumors. T. Caza and S. Landas summarize the epigenetic modifications of cytokine loci that determine CD4+ T cell lineage specifications and emphasize the interconnected role of the serine-threonine kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and the cellular metabolism in T helper subset polarization. \\n \\nT helper lymphocytes play a key role in promoting specific anticancer responses and in establishing immune memory. Tumors commonly escape from elimination by the immune system by using multiple strategies, notably the active suppression and the modulation of effector immune cells. Impaired effector T cell responses correlate with a poor prognosis in patients with solid tumors. Among numerous immune suppressive mechanisms employed by cancer, the deprivation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays an important role as ATP is essential for T cell activation. Extracellular ATP concentration is maintained by the ectonucleotidase CD39 which is involved in the suppression of T lymphocyte activation by CD11c+ dendritic cells infiltrating tumors in the mouse lung LLC and mammary 4T1 cancer models, as described by M. Trad et al. \\n \\nTo suppress T effector responses, tumors can promote Treg expansion and suppressive function which correlates with a poor prognosis in cancer patients. In human, the IL-7 receptor (CD127) is often used to distinguish CD4+CD25+ Treg from activated T cells. The expression of CD127 strongly correlates with that of FoxP3, a major transcription factor that participates to the development and regulatory function of CD4+CD25+ Treg. Treg suppressive functions rely on various mechanisms involving IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 or cell surface ligands. The upregulated expression of TGF-\u03b2 complexed with the latency associated peptide (LAP-TGF-\u03b2) on Treg provides an important functional hallmark in this subset. L. Islas-Vazquez et al. investigated the expression levels of LAP-TGF-\u03b2 within the CD4+CD25+CD127- Treg subset in patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma. The data indicate that the frequencies of LAP-TGF-\u03b2+ Treg are elevated and the expression level of the LAP-TGF-\u03b2 complex is significantly increased in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Additionally, the authors report that Th17 cells and related cytokines are increased in smoking subjects and lung adenocarcinoma patients. The results suggest that smoking represent an important cause of systemic inflammation, pointing out the Th17/Treg balance as an important checkpoint in the pathophysiology of lung adenocarcinoma. Complexity of Th17 responses in the context of tumor is further discussed by L. Guery and S. Hugues. Since the infiltration of tumors by Th17 is associated with a better outcome, a strategy to promote tumor-induced Treg differentiation toward a Th17 phenotype could be a beneficial approach for immunotherapeutic interventions. \\n \\nIn the same line, the research article by G. Tejon et al. demonstrates that vitamin A restrains the reprogramming of in vitro generated Treg into IL-17 producing cells in vivo in an adoptive Ag-specific T cell transfer model of mouse gut inflammation. The authors additionally report that the presence of IL-2 during in vitro generation of Treg confers resistance to Th17 conversion and that IL-2 cooperates with retinoic acid (RA) to maintain Foxp3 expression following stimulation under Th17-polarizing conditions. Of importance, gut microbiome significantly shapes T lymphocyte dynamics in an inflammatory condition such as IBD, as extensively reviewed by C. Larmonier et al. Therefore, Th17 and Treg stability and plasticity are regulated not only by the signals they receive during their generation but also by their local microenvironment. \\n \\nThe acute phase response also represents an example of peripheral immune modulation. In the context of systemic inflammation, some proteins, among which is \u03b11-antitrypsin, exert tolerogenic activities. The topic reviewed by B. Baranovski et al. underlines that \u03b11-antitrypsin can indirectly inhibit T cell responses, by targeting other immune cells. For instance, \u03b11-antitrypsin maintain the semimature state of DC which promotes Treg differentiation. This process appears pivotal during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and type 1 diabetes.', 'authors': ['N. Janikashvili', 'T. Chikovani', 'S.

Epigenetic characteristics contribute to molecular taxonomy and give rise to cancer-specific epigenetic patterns. Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection has an impact on aberrant DNA methylation either through its pathogenic CagA protein or by inducing chronic inflammation. The hypomethylation of specific repetitive elements generates an epigenetic field effect early in tumorigenesis. Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) infection triggers DNA methylation by dysregulating DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) enzyme activity, while persistent Hp-EBV co-infection leads to aggressive tumor behavior. Distinct histone modifications are also responsible for oncogene upregulation and tumor-suppressor gene silencing in gastric carcinomas. While histone methylation and acetylation processes have been extensively studied, other less prevalent alterations contribute to the development and migration of gastric cancer via a complex network of interactions. Enzymes, such as Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), which is involved in tumor\u2019s metabolic reprogramming, interact with methyltransferases and modify gene expression.

Induction of target genes without involving changes in DNA sequence seems to contribute greatly to liver injury. Chromatin modifications including alterations in histones and DNA, as well as post-transcriptional changes collectively referred to as epigenetic effects are altered by alcohol. Recent studies have pointed to a significant role for epigenetic mechanisms at the nucleosomal level influencing gene expression and disease outcome in ALD. Specifically, epigenetic alterations by alcohol include histone modifications such as changes in acetylation and phosphorylation, hypomethylation of DNA, and alterations in miRNAs. These modifications can be induced by alcohol-induced oxidative stress that results in altered recruitment of transcriptional machinery and abnormal gene expression. Delineating these mechanisms in initiation and progression of ALD is becoming a major area of interest. This review summarizes key epigenetic mechanisms that are dysregulated by alcohol in the liver. Alterations by alcohol in histone and DNA modifications, enzymes related to histone acetylation such as histone acetyltransferases, histone deacetylases and sirtuins, and methylation enzymes such as DNA methyltransferases are discussed.

The term epigenetics has been defined as the study of changes in gene expression that does not involve alterations in the underlying DNA sequence, hence the prefix epi (Greek meaning: over, around). In other words, a change in phenotype without a change in genotype. Such epigenetic-based processes involve chemical modifications to the DNA (i.e., DNA methylation and demethylation) or to the histones which form the cores of chromatin packaging (i.e., histone deacetylation, acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, etc.). A prominent role for non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), in epigenetic modulation of gene expression also exists. While epigenetics refers to the changes of single genes or sets of genes, the term epigenome reflects the overall epigenetic state of a cell and refers to the global analyses of epigenetic markers (e.g., DNA or histone methylation marks) across the entire genome. These genome-wide analyses are providing important information on epigenetic profiles associated with a particular cell or tissue type as well as specific disease states. From a clinical perspective, epigenomic data can be utilized to determine biomarkers for disease prediction and diagnosis. Importantly, since epigenetic changes are reversible, it is anticipated that development of new strategies to target epigenetic regulation will lead to new effective treatments to combat disease. Compared to research fields such as cancer and neurology, epigenetic studies in skeletal biology and disease are lagging behind. However, over the past five years, there have been important advances in our understanding of how epigenetic regulation affects cartilage and bone development. Significantly less is known on the role of epigenetics in modulating cartilage and bone homeostasis or disease. In this timely Special Issue, a series of comprehensive reviews and original research articles are presented that highlight the current status of epigenetic research in cartilage and bone as well as provide insight into future new directions in the field. We begin with a review by Lefebvre andDvir-Ginzberg on the master chondrocyte transcription factor, SOX9. Specifically, information is provided on mechanisms known to control expression and function of SOX9 in cartilage, including epigenetic-based mechanisms. This leads on to a research paper by Otero et al. showing how chondrocyte gene expression can be regulated via a mechanism that modifies SOX9/CBP-driven histone acetyltransferase (HAC) activity. Continuing with the theme of histone modifying enzymes, research is presented by Westendorf\u2019s group on the role of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in regulating cartilage development. Focusingmore on cartilage disease, a report is presented by invited speakers and/or organizers of the First InternationalWorkshop on the Epigenetics of Osteoarthritis (OA) that took place inAmsterdam last year. This is followed by a review article providing information on emerging evidence that inflammation appears to play an important role in regulating epigenetic factors that may subsequently lead to OA. Novel research is then presented by Drs. Makki and Haqqi on the effects of a HDAC inhibitor drug on blocking inflammatory-mediated pathways in human OA chondrocytes. Two review papers follow that focus on the current status of epigenetic research in bone development. The authors also provide insights into how epigenetic studies are important within the context of understanding bone diseases, such as osteoporosis. A method-based paper is included that describes an efficient approach for generating conditional gain-of-function mouse models to study the function of miRNAs (as well as other small non-coding RNAs) in vivo.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and accounts for nearly 51,000 deaths per year, the majority of which are associated with liver metastasis. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a cell surface glycoprotein that is produced and secreted by colorectal tumors, has been shown to predict the ability of CRC to metastasize. Of interest to our laboratory is that the consumption of alcohol has been shown to increase the risk of metastatic CRC. We hypothesize that ALD may actually contribute to the creation of a microenvironment that is conducive to CRC metastases. Since Kupffer cells (KCs) the resident liver macrophages, are known release proinflammatory cytokines in both ALD (Casey and McVicker laboratories) and when stimulated with CEA (Thomas laboratory), we are examining whether CEA contributes to the development of the hepatic inflammatory response in the setting of ALD.\\n\\nMethods. Male, Wistar rats were fed for 5-7 weeks with an ethanol-containing liquid diet (Lieber-DeCarli). We purified KCs from livers of these animals, and incubated the cells with 5 ug/ml CEA for 5 hours. After the 5 hour incubation period, media was analyzed for the presence of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6.\\n\\nResults/Conclusions. In the presence of CEA, KCs from both control and ethanol-fed rats showed significant increases in production of both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. In addition, cytokine production from KCs from alcohol-fed animals was increased two-fold when compared to controls. We are extending these findings by measuring other cytokines known to be produced in the setting of CRC and CEA activation.\\n\\n# S03.2 ALCOHOL INDUCED ALTERATIONS IN HEPATIC HDACS: A POTENTIAL LINK TO HCC {#article-title-3}\\n\\nAlcohol consumption is a significant risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) consists of the spectrum of pathological changes including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis and alcoholic cirrhosis, which can progress to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is becoming increasingly clear that besides genomic changes, epigenetic alterations play a significant role in the development of HCC. Histone deacetylation constitutes a major epigenetic alteration responsible for chromatin remodeling involving chromatin condensation and transcriptional down-regulation in the affected genomic regions. Histone acetylation and deacetylation are highly active processes and are controlled by the opposing action of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs); notably, altered expression and mutations of genes that encode HDACs have been linked to tumor development. Among the 18 HDAC isoforms divided in IV classes, class I HDACs are significantly involved in the development of cancer. Specifically, class I HDACs 1 - 3 are expressed at significantly higher levels in HCC than in normal liver. Our recent findings show that alcohol can significantly de-regulate the expression of hepatic Class I and II HDACs, thereby impacting both global and gene specific histone acetylation status with consequent alterations in gene expression. Moreover, Class I HDAC-3, which plays a significant role in regulating tumor cell proliferation and invasion in HCC, was solely and markedly increased in response to binge ethanol exposure. These data will be presented in the context of alcohol induced hepatic steatosis, injury and carcinogenesis.\\n\\n# S03.3 EFFECT OF ALCOHOL ON TUMOR PROGRESSION IN DIFFERENT MOUSE MODELS OF HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA {#article-title-4}\\n\\nChronic, heavy alcohol consumption and obesity are risk factors for HCC. Numerous rodent models of HCC exist as do methods of alcohol-feeding and obesity. This study sought to compare the effects of alcohol and/or obesity on HCC progression in mouse models of HCC, and to study miRNA profiles as markers of tumorigenesis. B6C3 mice readily (7/8) developed tumors 44-wks after DEN injection (1mg/Kg; 21d) and alcohol feeding in drinking water (10/20% alt.days, 8-wks) significantly increased tumor incidence and size. In contrast only 3/10 C57Bl/6 mice developed visible lesions following DEN initiation, despite DEN being administered at 5mg/Kg. Alcohol-feeding failed to significantly alter number or size of foci in the C57Bl/6 model. However, diet induced obesity (DIO) significantly increased incidence (8/9) and size of foci versus DEN-alone or DEN + alcohol. miRNA analysis demonstrated 34- and 17-dysregulated miRNAs, when comparing DIO-H2O-DEN and DIO-EtOH-DEN tumor to non-tumor liver respectively. Of these miRNAs, 7-were dysregulated in both groups. Finally, chronic alcohol intake significantly inhibited foci-tumor progression in a C57Bl/6 mouse model in which Hepa1-6 HCC cells were injected into the liver via a mesenteric vein. Our data highlight significant differences in the effect of alcohol on HCC progression based on both model and strain. Furthermore, these data suggest that in C57Bl/6, obesity is a more powerful promoter of HCC progression than alcohol. The (relatively) low number of miRNAs commonly dysregulated in these models also suggests miRNAs may be important links between models, and potential markers/targets in those patients at risk for HCC development.\\n\\n# S03.4 FAMILIAL NON-ALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS LEADING TO HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA {#article-title-5}\\n\\nIntroduction. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been associated with fibrosis that may progress to cirrhosis. The purpose of this study was to examine hepatocytes and Kupffer Cells (persinusoidal macrophages) in liver biopsies of 3 families (5 males and 4 females) with non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic NASH to determine unique histological changes during a period of 2\u20137 years from diagnosis.\\n\\nAims&Methods. In this study, hepatocytes, stellate cells and Kupffer Cells were analyzed using light and electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry with specific anti-macrophage antibody staining of liver biopsies. Evaluation for HBV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis, PBC, PSC, alpha-1 anti-trypsin disease, Wilson's disease, and hemochromatosis were negative. Abdo ultrasound demonstrated diffuse, extensive steatosis in all the patients and nodules consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in two patients.\\n\\nResults. BMI for all patients was over 30, and alcohol consumption was not significant. In all liver biopsies diffuse, macrovesicular steatosis involved 40 to 70% of samples. The lobular hepatocytes showed prominent ballooning degeneration. Mallory Denkhyaline bodies (MDBs) in four patients along with foci of lobular inflammation. The MDBs were observed by electron microscopy and stained by cytokeratin 18. The trichrome stain revealed bridging fibrosis. In family #1, there was a three-fold increase in Kupffer Cells in the eldest sibling with NASH compared to livers of the younger siblings. In addition, lipid droplets were more numerous and larger in the hepatocytes and the collagen deposits were 5 times larger compared to the siblings. In family #2, the older brother had cirrhosis; minimal inflammation and mild fatty infiltration while the younger had fatty infiltration with no inflammation or fibrosis. In family #3, large lipid droplets and collagen deposition were observed in the siblings, one of whom had HCC. Over 2-4 year follow up, all patients had progressive severity of NASH one of whom developed HCC.\\n\\nConclusion. The special finding in livers of patients with NASH was accumulation of groups of Kupffer Cells, which was not associated with focal necrosis. It is postulated that collections of these perisinusoidal macrophages in NASH are a unique response to chronic portal endotoxemia or bacteremia.

Abstract icroRNAs have recently gained popularity because of their critical roles in the regulation of many biological processes. Their expressions are found to be attributed to different inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a chronic autoimmune disorder that could be triggered due to genetic and epigenetic factors. Berberine (BBR) is an isoquinoline derivative alkaloid with a long history of medicinal use. It has wide anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidative activities. However, the effect of BBR on miRNA-146a-5p (miR-146a-5p) expression level has not yet been studied. Thus, the present study is the first report that explores the exact mechanism of BBR on modulating miR-146a-5p expression in adjuvant induced arthritis (AIA) model. The arthritis severity scoring was assessed using hematoxylin-eosin and toluidine blue staining. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining for the CD68+ macrophages expression was performed. MiR-146a-5p expression level was measured by reverse transcriptase quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The obtained results showed downregulation of miR-146a-5p associated with increased levels of antinuclear autoantibodies (ANA), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), IL-1\u03b2, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), IL-6, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and quantitative expression of CD68+ macrophages in AIA rat model. Remarkably, BBR treatment restores the levels of all these mediators. Collectively, the current results revealed the possible role of miR-146a-5p in the regulation of RA disease by manipulating TRAF6/IRAK1/NF-kB signaling as a macrophage inflammatory pathway. Furthermore, BBR showed potential ability to restore expression levels of miR-146a-5p and modulate NF-\u03baB pathway proteins in AIA rat model.', 'authors': ['S. S.

The verification results across multiple components suggest the following:\\n\\n1. **IL-17 and Epigenetic Modulation**: The findings from search results indicate moderate biological plausibility for the interaction between IL-17 pathway modulation and epigenetic states, particularly histone acetylation changes. While direct empirical studies confirming IL-17 blockers specifically altering histone acetylation in RA were not available, the mechanisms and biological contexts are well-supported in general literature concerning cytokine signaling and epigenetic interactions.\\n\\n2. **Histone Acetylation and miRNA Expression**: Consistent evidence supports that histone modifications, including acetylation, are crucial in regulating miRNA expression. This link is particularly strengthened by results demonstrating that such epigenetic states can influence miRNA profiles, impacting inflammatory signaling pathways.\\n\\n3. **miRNA and Transcription Factor Modulation**: There is substantial confirmation that miRNAs play a significant role in modulating transcription factor activity, linking their expression to cytokine signaling pathways, and supporting the broader mechanism proposed where miRNA expression influences NF-kB activity and inflammation.\\n\\n4. **NF-kB Suppression**: Although the direct complete pathway was not fully verified in a single study, multiple sources confirmed components such as miRNA and transcription factor interactions relevant to NF-kB modulation.\\n\\nThe literature reviewed indicates no significant contradictions but highlighted needs for more targeted research to directly link IL-17 cytokine therapies with specific histone modifications in RA models. Overall, the hypothesis is supported by the convergence of independently validated scientific principles and empirical findings regarding the interplay between cytokines, epigenetic modifications, miRNA regulation, and NF-kB activity:\\n\\n- **Verification Score**: **0.75** [indicating a strong, but not unanidedly complete, basis across verified components]\\n- **Confidence**: **0.8** [reflects substantial support from multiple, independent findings across different research facets within rheumatology and molecular immunology]\\n\\nFurther experimental research directly connecting IL-17 targeting to histone acetylation linked to miRNA modification impacting NF-kB pathways would be crucial in fully substantiating and translating this hypothesis into therapeutic advancements.\",\"justification\":\"This assessment is based on the combined literature and study analyses that collectively support the proposed mechanistic hypothesis within the context of existing molecular biology and rheumatology research. The structured approach in integrating multiple research findings aligns with known cytokine signaling pathways, epigenetic modifications, miRNA interactions, and NF-kB regulation, thus rendering the hypothesis scientifically plausible. However, the need for more focused studies to validate the specific trajectories in this pathway engenders a moderate verification score and an accompanying degree of research confidence.\",\"source_id\":\"Rheumatology-Hypothesis-Assessment\"}", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}], "model": "gpt-4o", "model_config": {"temperature": null, "top_p": null, "frequency_penalty": null, "presence_penalty": null, "tool_choice": null, "parallel_tool_calls": null, "truncation": null, "max_tokens": null, "reasoning": null, "metadata": null, "store": null, "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/"}, "usage": {"input_tokens": 15438, "output_tokens": 658}}, "error": null}

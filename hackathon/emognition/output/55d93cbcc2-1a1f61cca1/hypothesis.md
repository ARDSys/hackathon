# Hypothesis and Assessment on Denosumab's Impact in Rheumatoid Arthritis

**Hypothesis ID:** 1a1f61cca17173499be027d85e23d1d4e0030f4cba828c043332478766fea4a2

** The administration of Denosumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis alters the systemic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-17 and IL-23, leading to an unexpected decrease in osteoclast differentiation and a stabilization of bone mineral density (BMD). This proposes that Denosumab may have immunomodulatory effects beyond its role in bone resorption.

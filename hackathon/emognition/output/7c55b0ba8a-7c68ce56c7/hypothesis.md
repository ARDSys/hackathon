# BTK Inhibitors and Epigenetic Modulation in Rheumatoid Arthritis

**Hypothesis ID:** 7c68ce56c794659266f5711780c4b07378a99f68fdab443e02c16b73aa1a92e0

** BTK inhibitors can selectively modulate the epigenetic landscape of T and B cells, enhancing immune tolerance mechanisms to autoantigens in rheumatoid arthritis, thereby reducing the overproduction of autoantibodies.

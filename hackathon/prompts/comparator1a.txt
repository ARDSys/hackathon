You are an expert evaluator tasked with comparing two hypotheses.

Hypothesis 1:
{h1}

Hypothesis 2:
{h2}

Evaluate the two provided hypotheses (Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2) according to the following criteria:

1. **Novelty** – Are the hypotheses presenting truly original ideas, or are they simply reiterating existing research or drawing obvious conclusions from prior work?
2. **Plausibility & Validity** – Assess how likely it is that each hypothesis is correct, based on current knowledge and reasoning.
3. **Feasibility & Testability** – If a hypothesis cannot be tested, it has limited scientific value. Evaluate whether it is feasible to test each hypothesis and determine its validity.
4. **Potential Impact & Significance** – If proven true, would the hypothesis offer significant benefits to society or meaningfully deepen our understanding in its field?
5. **Clarity & Specificity** – The hypothesis should be clear and specific. While it does not need to be understandable to a layperson, it should be precise and interpretable by someone familiar with the relevant field.

For each of these five criteria, determine which hypothesis is superior, or if they are similarly strong in that category. Your final output should include a list stating, for each criterion, one of the following:
"1st is definitely better in this criterion," "1st is slightly better," "both are very similarly good," "2nd is slightly better," or "2nd is definitely better."
Provide a thorough rationale for each of your selections.

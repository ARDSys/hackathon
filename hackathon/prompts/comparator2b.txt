Now, let's assign scores to each of those verdicts:
 - 1st is definitely better: +2
 - 1st is slightly better: +1
 - both are similarly good: 0
 - 2nd is slightly better: -1
 - 2nd is definitely better: -2
Sum the scores across all categories. Thus, the final score should be between -8 and +8. So, if overall 2nd is better across most criterias, the final number will be negative, and if 1st is better - the final number will be positive.
At the very end of your response, write the final number which is the sum across all categories.

"A 23-year-old Caucasian male from Zaragoza, with no history of pathology or family history of note. Since the age of five he presented self-limited episodes of fever up to 39ºC, diffuse abdominal pain, generalised myalgias and erythematous lesions on the lower legs. At the age of 10 he underwent appendectomy, although no inflammatory signs were evident in the appendix. The episodes last about 2-3 days, improve with NSAIDs and recur every 1-2 months. During the febrile outbreaks, physical examination revealed diffuse abdominal pain with defence to superficial palpation and erysipeloid lesions on the anterolateral and distal aspect of the legs, and blood tests showed elevated C-reactive protein up to 6 mg/dL (N <1mg/dL), which normalised during periods without fever. What is the most likely initial diagnosis? Justify your answer

1. Muckle-Wells syndrome (periodic cryopyrin-associated syndrome).
2. Familial Mediterranean fever.
3. Blau's syndrome (arthrocutaneouveal granulomatosis).

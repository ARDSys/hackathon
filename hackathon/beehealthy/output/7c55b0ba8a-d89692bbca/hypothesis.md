1. Refined Hypothesis:  
In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients exhibiting smoking‐associated epigenetic modifications in T cells, a dual‐target therapeutic regimen combining a low‐dose, selective BTK inhibitor with a highly specific HDAC inhibitor—administered via an adaptive, biomarker‐guided dosing strategy informed by integrated computational PK/PD modeling and rigorous preclinical validation—will synergistically reduce autoantibody production and inflammatory joint damage. Specifically, by simultaneously dampening BTK‐mediated B cell receptor signaling and correcting aberrant T cell epigenetic marks, the treatment will downregulate TNF‑α–induced activation of the NF‑κB pathway in synovial fibroblasts, leading to decreased MMP expression, preservation of the cartilage extracellular matrix, and lower serum CTX‑I levels. In addition, supplementing the regimen with smoking cessation support will further promote sustained epigenetic normalization and improved clinical outcomes.

2. Scientific Rationale:  
• The hypothesis integrates two pivotal nodes from the knowledge graph: BTK’s role in B cell receptor signaling (which drives autoantibody production) and smoking‐induced epigenetic modifications in T cells (which enhance pro-inflammatory cytokine production leading to NF‑κB activation).  
• By targeting BTK with a selective inhibitor, the regimen directly interrupts a major pathway of B cell–driven autoimmunity, while the HDAC inhibitor is expected to normalize the dysregulated epigenetic status in T cells that exacerbate inflammation.  
• The resulting decrease in TNF‑α–induced NF‑κB activation should reduce the expression of MMPs in synovial fibroblasts, thereby preserving the integrity of the cartilage extracellular matrix and mitigating joint damage.  
• Employing adaptive dosing guided by validated biomarkers (including T cell epigenetic signatures, TNF‑α levels, NF‑κB activity, MMP expression, and CTX‑I) and refined computational models provides a systematic framework to optimize efficacy and minimize off‐target immunosuppression.  
• The incorporation of a smoking cessation component directly addresses the environmental factor that triggers the epigenetic alterations, adding an extra layer of therapeutic precision.

3. Predicted Outcomes:  
• Preclinical models (e.g., collagen-induced arthritis) are predicted to demonstrate a synergistic reduction in both autoantibody levels and inflammatory cytokines compared to monotherapies.  
• A measurable decline in NF‑κB signaling (reflected in lower MMP expression) and stabilization of cartilage integrity should be observed, correlating with reduced serum CTX‑I levels.  
• The adaptive, biomarker‐guided dosing strategy is expected to identify an optimal therapeutic window that maintains efficacy while avoiding broad immunosuppression, as evidenced by preserved normal immune function.  
• In early-phase clinical trials, patients—particularly those with smoking‐related epigenetic dysregulation—should demonstrate improved joint symptoms and functional status, alongside favorable biomarker shifts.

4. Relevance and Purpose:  
• Rheumatoid arthritis remains a therapeutically challenging disease, especially in patient subsets where environmental factors like smoking exacerbate pathogenic epigenetic changes.  
• This hypothesis proposes a precision medicine approach that not only targets the immunologic and epigenetic basis of RA but also strategically integrates patient stratification and dynamic dose personalization.  
• By addressing the key mechanistic nodes driving autoimmunity and joint degradation, this regimen has the potential to offer more durable disease control and improved quality of life while reducing long-term joint deformities.  
• The inclusion of supportive smoking cessation efforts further targets the root environmental cause of epigenetic dysregulation, offering a comprehensive strategy that could be extrapolated to other complex autoimmune conditions.

5. Novelty Considerations:  
• The dual‐target approach of simultaneously modulating BTK‐mediated B cell receptor signaling and smoking‐induced epigenetic aberrations in T cells is a novel therapeutic concept not previously explored in an integrated, biomarker‐guided framework.  
• The use of advanced computational PK/PD modeling to inform adaptive dosing represents a cutting‐edge method that merges systems pharmacology with precision medicine, potentially setting a new standard for therapeutic development in autoimmune disorders.  
• Targeting a well‐defined RA patient subpopulation based on smoking‐associated epigenetic markers is innovative and adds a layer of personalization that could enhance efficacy and safety compared to broader treatment strategies.  
• While both BTK inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors have been individually investigated in RA, their rational combination with precise biomarker monitoring—and the proactive incorporation of non-pharmacological interventions such as smoking cessation—distinguishes this proposal from existing paradigms.

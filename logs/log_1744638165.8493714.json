    "llm_response": "After analyzing the input data, it seems that the absence of good PubMed results could indicate various possibilities. It is essential to consider the reasons behind the lack of relevant information. One potential reason could be that the search terms used were too specific or too broad, leading to a lack of suitable results. Another possibility could be that the research topic is relatively new or not extensively studied in the medical field.\n\nTo address this issue, we can review and revise the search terms used in the PubMed search to ensure they are targeting the most relevant and up-to-date information. Additionally, we can explore alternative databases or sources of information that may provide valuable insights into the hypothesis being investigated. Collaborating with experts in the field or reaching out to researchers who have conducted similar studies could also help fill in the gaps in the data.\n\nIn terms of next steps, we should consider conducting a thorough literature review to gather more comprehensive information on the topic. This can help us identify any existing studies that support or refute the hypothesis, as well as provide insights into potential research gaps that need to be addressed. By carefully examining the dependencies between the data and considering all relevant factors, we can develop more informed and innovative papers in the medical field.",

    "llm_response": "Given the lack of a good PubMed result, it's essential to leverage other reputable sources such as clinical trial registries, preprint servers, or specialty databases to validate the hypothesis. Additionally, engaging with experts in the field through conferences or networking events could provide valuable insights to support or refute the hypothesis. \n\nIt would also be beneficial to consider conducting a systematic review or meta-analysis to synthesize existing evidence on the topic and identify any gaps or inconsistencies in the literature. This approach can help generate new hypotheses or guide future research directions based on a comprehensive analysis of available data. \n\nIf there are specific aspects of the hypothesis that are unclear or require further clarification, reaching out to colleagues or collaborating with other researchers with relevant expertise can help refine the research question and strengthen the validity of the findings. By actively seeking out new information and fostering collaborations, the team can enhance the scientific rigor and clinical relevance of the research process.",

This indicates a need to expand the search to other databases to gather more relevant information. \n\nTo remove irrelevant data, we should focus on the challenges presented, such as limited results from PubMed, and emphasize the importance of reassessing the initial hypothesis and considering alternative perspectives. \n\nIdentifying gaps in the data is crucial for next steps. We must critically evaluate the hypothesis, examine dependencies between data points, and address any biases or limitations that may have influenced the outcome. \n\nMoving forward, we need to pay attention to dependencies between the data points to ensure that all relevant information is taken into account in building innovative conclusions in the medical field. Collaborating with other experts and gaining diverse perspectives will also be vital in identifying biases and limitations in the data, leading to the development of impactful papers. \n\nIt is essential to refine the hypothesis based on new information gathered and maintain a systematic and rigorous approach throughout the analysis process. By taking these steps, we can generate precise and innovative conclusions that will support decision-making in the medical field.",

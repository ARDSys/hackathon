    "llm_response": "Key Information:\n- Lack of good PubMed results for the research proposal\n- Potential reasons behind the lack of relevant data (specificity of search query, selection criteria, keywords used)\n- Collaboration with team of scientists is essential for brainstorming innovative approaches\n- Addressing gaps in data and refining hypothesis based on sound reasoning is crucial for generating new innovative papers\n\nGaps in the Data:\n1. The specific reasons behind the lack of good PubMed results need to be identified, such as overly narrow search query, vague selection criteria, or ineffective keywords.\n2. It is necessary to expand the search to other medical research databases to gather additional data and fill in existing gaps in the literature.\n3. Potential biases or limitations in the current literature need to be addressed to ensure the validity and reliability of the conclusions drawn from the analysis.\n\nNext Steps:\n1. Investigate and determine the reasons behind the lack of good PubMed results, focusing on search query specificity, selection criteria, and keywords used.\n2. Expand the search to other medical research databases and refine search terms to gather more accurate and comprehensive data.\n3. Collaborate with the team of scientists to brainstorm innovative approaches to address data gaps and refine the hypothesis.\n4. Ensure that dependencies between the data are considered in future analyses to develop a comprehensive research approach and generate new innovative papers in the medical field.",

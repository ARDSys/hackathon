    "llm_response": "Key Information Analysis:\nBased on the input data, the key information includes the significant gap in existing literature, the importance of search term selection, lack of consensus in the scientific community, the need for collaboration with experts, critical evaluation of evidence, and defining a clear research plan. These factors indicate a complex and challenging research environment that requires careful navigation and thorough analysis.\n\nIrrelevant data Removal:\nTo focus on elements that directly impact the outcome, we should remove any extraneous information that does not contribute to addressing the gaps in knowledge, validating the hypothesis, or defining a research plan. This will streamline the analysis process and allow for a more targeted approach to generating innovative papers.\n\nGaps in the data and Next Steps:\nThe gaps in existing literature and conflicting findings suggest a need for a detailed analysis to identify areas for further investigation. Collaborating with experts in the medical field is essential to gain valuable insights that can help fill these gaps. In addition, expanding search parameters and considering dependencies between different elements of the data will uncover new perspectives and ensure a comprehensive analysis. Defining a research plan with input from relevant experts will help address uncertainties and validate the credibility of the findings.\n\nDependencies between data:\nIt is crucial to consider the dependencies between different elements of the data to ensure a holistic analysis. This may involve examining how certain variables interact with each other, how different studies correlate with the hypothesis, and how new insights from collaborations with experts influence the research plan. By understanding these dependencies, we can generate innovative papers that build on a solid foundation of interconnected data points.\n\nIn conclusion, by carefully analyzing the input data, focusing on key information, removing irrelevant data, identifying gaps, considering dependencies, and proposing next steps, we can work towards creating innovative papers in the medical field that advance knowledge and contribute to groundbreaking discoveries.",

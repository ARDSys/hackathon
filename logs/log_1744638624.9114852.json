The absence of relevant results on PubMed indicates a potential lack of extensive research or validation of the hypothesis in medical literature. This suggests an opportunity for innovative research in the medical field.\n\n2. The importance of carefully considering the search terms and keywords used in initial searches cannot be understated. Adjusting and expanding these terms may yield different results and uncover new insights.\n\n3. The lack of consensus or conflicting findings in the scientific community regarding the hypothesis underscores the need for critical evaluation of available evidence and potentially conducting new studies to address uncertainties.\n\n4. Collaboration with experts in the medical field is crucial for gaining valuable insights and guidance on how to effectively investigate the hypothesis further.\n\nTo move forward and create innovative papers in the medical field, we must first address the gaps in the data by conducting a thorough analysis of existing information, identifying areas for further exploration, and collaborating with relevant experts. By taking these steps, we can pave the way for groundbreaking research and contribute to advancements in medical knowledge.",

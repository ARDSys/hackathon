To address this issue and ensure the success of our research, we need to focus on refining our search criteria and keywords.\n\nOne key piece of information is the importance of collaborating with subject matter experts to brainstorm alternative keywords and search terms. This suggests that the current keywords may not be capturing the full scope of relevant information, leading to limited results. By extending our search to include other reputable medical databases and sources beyond PubMed, we can gather a more comprehensive dataset that may uncover valuable insights.\n\nFurthermore, the suggestion to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a systematic review is crucial in aggregating all available evidence related to the hypothesis. This step will help us identify any gaps in the data and determine if there are any limitations hindering our research process. It is essential to explore unconventional sources of information, such as conference proceedings or preprint repositories, to ensure we are not overlooking valuable data that could contribute to our analysis.\n\nLastly, developing a deeper understanding of the research question and potential variables that could influence the outcomes is crucial in formulating precise and impactful conclusions. By considering these dependencies between the data and incorporating them into our analysis, we can ensure that our research is thorough, evidence-based, and innovative.\n\nIn conclusion, the next steps should involve refining search criteria, collaborating with experts, exploring alternative sources of information, conducting a systematic review, and gaining a deeper understanding of the research question. By following these steps, we can overcome the challenges posed by the current lack of significant results and generate groundbreaking papers in the medical field.",

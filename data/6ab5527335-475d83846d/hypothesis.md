1. Research Hypothesis:  
In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), chronic metabolic reprogramming leads to excessive intracellular lactate accumulation that impairs the microRNA biogenesis machinery—specifically reducing the activity of key processors like Drosha and Dicer. This impairment causes a decline in microRNAs that normally repress transcription factors and histone acetyltransferases responsible for regulating IL17A and IL17F gene promoters. The resulting imbalance in histone acetylation facilitates excessive IL-17 cytokine expression, thereby establishing a self‐reinforcing inflammatory cascade. Therapeutic restoration of normal lactate levels or protection of microRNA processing should recalibrate the epigenetic landscape and mitigate RA pathology.

2. Scientific Rationale:  
• The knowledge graph illustrates that IL17A and IL17F gene expression is tightly regulated through epigenetic modifications (e.g., histone acetylation), which are modulated by microRNAs known to target transcription factors involved in immune cell differentiation.  
• RA is characterized by chronic oxidative stress, which not only activates the NF-κB pathway but also promotes a shift toward aerobic glycolysis. This metabolic reprogramming elevates lactate levels—a molecule already implicated in alternative epigenetic modifications such as histone lactylation.  
• While lactate’s role in directly modifying histones is an emergent field, we propose an unconventional connection: that excessive lactate can interfere with the microRNA processing machinery. This interference would degrade the cellular reserves of microRNAs that normally target and restrain the activators of IL-17 expression.  
• Thus, the unexpected link between lactate accumulation and impaired microRNA maturation provides a mechanistic bridge connecting metabolic stress with dysregulated epigenetic control over pro-inflammatory IL-17 pathways.

3. Predicted Outcome or Behavior:  
• RA immune cells (e.g., Th17 cells) are expected to show reduced Drosha/Dicer activities along with a distinct microRNA expression profile characterized by lower levels of microRNAs that normally inhibit key transcription factors and histone acetyltransferases involved in IL17 promoter regulation.  
• Molecular assays should reveal enhanced histone acetylation at IL17A and IL17F gene regions associated with elevated lactate levels.  
• Experimental interventions that either reduce lactate accumulation or otherwise support the microRNA processing pathway (e.g., via protective small molecules or microRNA mimics) should restore normal histone acetylation patterns and lower IL-17 cytokine production in vitro and in animal models.  
• Ultimately, such interventions are predicted to reduce inflammatory markers and improve clinical symptoms in RA models.

4. Relevance and Purpose:  
• By linking metabolic alterations to epigenetic and microRNA dysregulation, this hypothesis addresses a gap in understanding how intracellular energy shifts in RA contribute to chronic inflammation.  
• Targeting the dual axis of lactate-induced impairment of microRNA biogenesis and subsequent epigenetic misregulation offers a novel therapeutic avenue. Instead of broadly suppressing the immune response, interventions could specifically restore the disrupted regulatory circuitry at the IL-17 locus.  
• This approach may lead to more precise treatments with fewer side effects, providing new biomarker opportunities for disease activity and therapeutic response in RA patients.

5. Novelty Considerations:  
• Although metabolic dysregulation and microRNA involvement have been individually implicated in RA, the direct effect of elevated lactate on the microRNA processing machinery is largely unexplored.  
• This hypothesis departs from the conventional focus on lactate’s role solely as a substrate for histone modifications (e.g., lactylation) by suggesting that lactate can also disrupt the production of key regulatory microRNAs.  
• The integration of metabolic state, microRNA biogenesis impairment, and subsequent epigenetic dysregulation constitutes an innovative concept that could redefine the pathogenic framework of RA.  
• While overlaps exist with established research on microRNA modulation and epigenetic control in autoimmune inflammation, proposing lactate as a disruptor of microRNA maturation opens a new dimension in understanding and potentially treating RA.

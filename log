--- Paper 1: CDK7 inhibition suppresses rheumatoid arthritis inflammation via blockage of NF‐κB activation and IL‐1β/IL‐6 secretion ---
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by joint swelling, joint tenderness and destruction of synovial joints, leading to severe disability. Anti‐inflammatory drugs and disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may improve RA process. However, in most patients the treatment effect is still not satisfactory. Cyclin‐dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) plays a well‐established role in the regulation of the eukaryotic cell division cycle, and recent studies indicated that it exerted anti‐inflammatory effect. In our previous research, we found that inhibition of CDK7 by highly selective inhibitor BS‐181 significantly impeded the development of collagen‐induced arthritis (CIA) mice. However, the underlying mechanism of CDK7 in RA remains to be explored. We elucidated the molecular mechanism of CDK7 inhibition in RA inflammation by administration of CDK7 highly selective inhibitor BS‐181 and siRNA‐CDK7. We found that both IL‐1β, IL‐6, IL‐8 and RANKL transcript levels and IL‐1β/IL‐6 secretion were effectively suppressed by BS‐181 treatment as well as CDK7 knockdown. Furthermore, CDK7 inhibition prevented NF‐κB signalling pathway activation and restrained p65 nuclear translocation. Moreover, CDK7 selective inhibitor BS‐181 also blocked phosphorylation of p65 in MH7A cells. These results strongly indicate that CDK7 inhibition by BS‐181 and siRNA‐CDK7 significantly suppresses rheumatoid arthritis inflammation, which may be via blockage of NF‐κB signalling pathway and IL‐1β/IL‐6 secretion.

--- Paper 2: Long Non-coding RNA HIX003209 Promotes Inflammation by Sponging miR-6089 via TLR4/NF-κB Signaling Pathway in Rheumatoid Arthritis ---
Accumulating studies have suggested that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have drawn more and more attention in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which can function as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) in inflammation and immune disorders. Previously, we have found that lncRNA HIX003209 is differentially expressed in RA. However, the precise mechanism of lncRNA HIX003209 in RA is still vague. We aim to elucidate the role and its targeted microRNA of lncRNA HIX003209 in RA as ceRNA. Significantly increased expression of lncRNA HIX003209 was observed in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA cases. It was positively associated with TLR2 and TLR4 in RA. Besides, peptidoglycan (PGN) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) could enhance the expression of lncRNA HIX003209, which reversely promoted the proliferation and activation of macrophages through IκBα/NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, HIX003209 was involved in TLR4-mediated inflammation via targeting miR-6089 in macrophages. LncRNA HIX003209 functions as a ceRNA and exaggerates inflammation by sponging miR-6089 through TLR4/NF-κB pathway in macrophages, which offers promising therapeutic strategies for RA.

--- Paper 3: miR‐488 mediates negative regulation of the AKT/NF‐κB pathway by targeting Rac1 in LPS‐induced inflammation ---
Endometritis is an inflammatory change in the structure of the endometrium due to various causes and is a common cause of infertility. Studies have confirmed that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a key regulatory role in various inflammatory diseases. However, the miRNA‐mediated mechanism of endometrial inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) remains unclear. In this study, real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence and Rac family small GTPase 1 (Rac1) interference were used to reveal the overexpression of miR‐488 in the LPS‐induced bovine uterus, and the effect of protein kinase B κ‐light chain enhancement of the nuclear factor‐activated B cells (AKT/NF‐κB) pathway in intimal epithelial cells. The results showed that the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β), IL‐6, and tumor necrosis factor‐α in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in the control group when miR‐488 was overexpressed. Similar results were observed in the expression levels of p‐AKT, p‐IKK, and p‐p65 proteins. In addition, the dual‐luciferase reporter system confirmed that miRNA‐488 may directly target the 3′‐untranslated region of Rac1. In turn, the expression of Rac1 was inhibited. Moreover, the nuclear translocation of NF‐κB was inhibited, and meanwhile, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cells was reduced. Thus, we provide basic data for the negative regulation of miR‐488 in LPS‐induced inflammation by inhibiting ROS production and the AKT/NF‐kB pathway in intimal epithelial cells.

--- Paper 4: Elevated microRNA-145-5p increases matrix metalloproteinase-9 by activating the nuclear factor-κB pathway in rheumatoid arthritis ---
The present study explored whether miR-145-5p can aggravate the development and progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by regulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). ELISAs, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and western blotting were used to examine the expression levels of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13 in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from patients with RA. Levels of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13 were assessed in the right hind ankles of a murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. The effects of activation or inhibition of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway on MMPs were evaluated by RT-qPCR and western blotting. Subcellular localization of NF-κB p65 was visualized by confocal microscopy. Overexpression of miR-145-5p increased the expression of MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13 in RA-FLS. Moreover, injection of a miR-145-5p agomir into mice increased MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13, as demonstrated by RT-qPCR and IHC analysis. A chemical inhibitor that selectively targets NF-κB (BAY11-7082) significantly attenuated MMP-9 expression, while it did not influence the levels of MMP-3 and MMP-13. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that nuclear localization of p65 was significantly enhanced, indicating that miR-145-5p enhances activation of the NF-κB pathway by promoting p65 nuclear translocation. miR-145-5p overexpression also significantly increased phosphorylated p65 levels; however, the levels of IkB-a were reduced in response to this miRNA. Moreover, our results indicated that miR-145-5p aggravated RA progression by activating the NF-κB pathway, which enhanced secretion of MMP-9. In conclusion, modulation of miR-145-5p expression is potentially useful for the treatment of RA inflammation, by regulating the expression of MMPs, and MMP-9 in particular, through inhibition of the NF-κB pathway.

--- Paper 5: β-Sitosterol-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles ameliorate complete Freund’s adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats: involvement of NF-кB and HO-1/Nrf-2 pathway ---
Abstract Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), autoimmune disease that is categorized via chronic inflammation manifestation, obesity, cardiovascular risk and even enhanced the mortality and affect the 0.3 and 1% of population worldwide. The current experimental study was scrutinize the anti-arthritic effect of β-sitosterol loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) against complete Fruend adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritis via dual pathway. Double emulsion solvent displacement method was used for the preparation of β-sitosterol solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN). CFA was used to induce arthritis and rats were divided into different groups for 28 days. Biochemical, anti-inflammatory, pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediator were estimated, respectively. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2), Heme Oxygenase-1(HO-1) and Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) expression were estimated. β-sitosterol-SLN significantly (p < .001) reduced the paw edema, arthritic index and increased the body weight. β-sitosterol-SLN increased the redox status of synovium {reduce the malonaldehyde (MDA) and increase superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT)} level and reduced the cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-2, interleukin-6, interleukin-16, interleukin-17 and increased level of interleukin-10, Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). β-sitosterol-SLN significantly (p < .001) reduced the level of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and NF-κB. β-sitosterol-SLN significantly increased the expression of HO-1,Nrf2 and decreased the expression of NF-κB, RANKL, STAT3. In conclusion, β-sitosterol SLN showed the antiarthritic effect via suppression of NF-kB and activation of HO-1/Nrf-2 pathway.

The relationship between the NF-kB pathway and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is critically influenced by specific microRNAs (miRNAs) that can modulate this pathway. For instance, the inhibition of CDK7 was shown to suppress inflammation in RA by blocking NF-kB activation, indicating a potential intersection of signaling pathways where miRNAs might play a role (CDK7 inhibition suppresses rheumatoid arthritis inflammation via blockage of NF‐κB activation and IL‐1β/IL‐6 secretion, Hong et al., Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, 2017). Additionally, the study identifying lncRNA HIX003209 highlights its ability to aggravate inflammation by sponging miR-6089, linking NF-kB signaling with the competitive endogenous RNA activity of miRNAs (Long Non-coding RNA HIX003209 Promotes Inflammation by Sponging miR-6089 via TLR4/NF-κB Signaling Pathway in Rheumatoid Arthritis, Yan et al., Frontiers in Immunology, 2019). Furthermore, research demonstrates that elevated miR-145-5p activates the NF-kB pathway, thus exacerbating inflammation by increasing matrix metalloproteinase expression, suggesting that direct modulation of specific miRNAs may offer therapeutic potential in RA management (Elevated microRNA-145-5p increases matrix metalloproteinase-9 by activating the nuclear factor-κB pathway in rheumatoid arthritis, Wang et al., Molecular Medicine Reports, 2019). These findings point to a complex regulatory network involving miRNAs in the NF-kB pathway that could be further explored for innovative RA treatments.

--- Paper 1: Mesenchymal stem cell-originated exosomal lncRNA HAND2-AS1 impairs rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocyte activation through miR-143-3p/TNFAIP3/NF-κB pathway ---
Background Long non-coding RNA heart and neural crest derivatives expressed 2-antisense RNA 1 (HAND2-AS1) was found to be elevated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs). However, whether HAND2-AS1 functions as an exosomal lncRNA related to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in RA progression is unknown. Methods The expression of HAND2-AS1, microRNA (miR)-143-3p, and tumor necrosis factor alpha-inducible protein 3 (TNFAIP3) was detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were detected using cell counting kit-8, flow cytometry, and wound healing and transwell assays. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukins (IL)-6 were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The level of phosphorylated-p65 was examined by Western blot. The binding interaction between miR-143-3p and HAND2-AS1 or TNFAIP3 was confirmed by the dual-luciferase reporter and RIP assays. Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation and qualified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and Western blot. Results HAND2-AS1 was lowly expressed in RA synovial tissues, and HAND2-AS1 re-expression suppressed the proliferation, motility, and inflammation and triggered the apoptosis in RA-FLSs via the inactivation of NF-κB pathway. Mechanistically, HAND2-AS1 directly sponged miR-143-3p and positively regulated TNFAIP3 expression, the target of miR-143-3p. Moreover, the effects of HAND2-AS1 on RA-FLSs were partially attenuated by miR-143-3p upregulation or TNFAIP3 knockdown. HAND2-AS1 could be packaged into hMSC-derived exosomes and absorbed by RA-FLSs, and human MSC-derived exosomal HAND2-AS1 also repressed above malignant biological behavior of RA-FLSs. Conclusion MSC-derived exosomes participated in the intercellular transfer of HAND2-AS1 and suppressed the activation of RA-FLSs via miR-143-3p/TNFAIP3/NF-κB pathway, which provided a novel insight into the pathogenesis and treatment of RA.

--- Paper 2: METTL3/N6‐methyladenosine/ miR‐21‐5p promotes obstructive renal fibrosis by regulating inflammation through SPRY1/ERK/NF‐κB pathway activation ---
Renal fibrosis induced by urinary tract obstruction is a common clinical occurrence; however, effective treatment is lacking, and a deeper understanding of the mechanism of renal fibrosis is needed. Previous studies have revealed that miR‐21 impacts liver and lung fibrosis progression by activating the SPRY1/ERK/NF‐kB signalling pathway. However, whether miR‐21 mediates obstructive renal fibrosis through the same signalling pathway has not been determined. Additionally, studies have shown that N6‐methyladenosine (m6A) modification‐dependent primary microRNA (pri‐microRNA) processing is essential for maturation of microRNAs, but its role in the maturation of miR‐21 in obstructive renal fibrosis has not yet been investigated in detail. To address these issues, we employed a mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in which the left ureters were ligated for 3, 7 and 14 days to simulate the fibrotic process. In vitro, human renal proximal tubular epithelial (HK‐2) cells were transfected with plasmids containing the corresponding sequence of METTL3, miR‐21‐5p mimic or miR‐21‐5p inhibitor. We found that the levels of miR‐21‐5p and m6A modification in the UUO model groups increased significantly, and as predicted, the SPRY1/ERK/NF‐kB pathway was activated by miR‐21‐5p, confirming that miR‐21‐5p plays an important role in obstructive renal fibrosis by enhancing inflammation. METTL3 was found to play a major catalytic role in m6A modification in UUO mice and drove obstructive renal fibrosis development by promoting miR‐21‐5p maturation. Our research is the first to demonstrate the role of the METTL3‐m6A‐miR‐21‐5p‐SPRY1/ERK/NF‐kB axis in obstructive renal fibrosis and provides a deeper understanding of renal fibrosis.

--- Paper 3: Review: A20‐Binding Inhibitor of NF‐κB Activation 1 Is a Physiologic Inhibitor of NF‐κB: A Molecular Switch for Inflammation and Autoimmunity ---
NF-kB comprises a family of transcription factors that have critical roles in inflammatory signaling and innate and adaptive immunity (1). NF-kB regulates the transcription of genes involved in immune inflammatory responses, cell survival, cell cycle progression, and cell adhesion. Activation of NF-kB by specific ligand– receptor interactions induces the expression of proinflammatory mediators that orchestrate the recruitment of immune cells, induce the inflammatory response, and cause tissue injury (2,3). In this way, excessive NF-kB activity is considered harmful and a pathogenic factor in the chronic inflammation in numerous autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease (4). The association between NF-kB overactivity and autoimmunity emphasizes the importance of tightly controlled NF-kB signaling. One protein that regulates NF-kB signaling and maintains immune homeostasis is A20-binding inhibitor of NF-kB activation 1 (ABIN-1). ABIN-1 is a polyubiquitinbinding protein that functions as an inhibitor of NF-kB, JNK, ERK, and p38 MAPK proinflammatory signaling pathways (5,6). ABIN-1 shares homologous regions with its familial proteins, ABIN-2 and ABIN-3, that mediate A20 binding and polyubiquitin binding (5,7,8). Although the functional roles of A20 and polyubiquitin binding are unclear, both have been proposed to participate in the inhibitory mechanism of ABIN-1. Disruption of polyubiquitin binding in ABIN-1 promotes NF-kB and proinflammatory signaling, thereby enhancing the production of proinflammatory mediators (5,7). In vivo, this disruption is associated with glomerulonephritis and lupus-like inflammatory disease states (5,9). The role of ABIN-1 in the prevention of human autoimmune and inflammatory disorders is currently being explored. The focus of this review is to discuss the molecular mechanisms by which ABIN-1 functions and to describe its importance for immune homeostasis based on findings from human genetic and animal studies.

--- Paper 4: MicroRNA-146a suppresses rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes proliferation and inflammatory responses by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-kB signaling ---
This study investigated whether microRNA-146a (miR-146a) mediating TLR4/NF-κB pathway affected proliferation and inflammatory responses of rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes from 12 RA patients (RA-FLSs). FLSs in the logarithmic growth phase were assigned into the control, miR-146a mimic miR-146a inhibitor, Tak-242 (treated with TLR4/NF-κB pathway inhibitor) and mimic + lipopolysaccharide (LPS) groups. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected using CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. The expression of miR-146a, TLR4/NF-κB pathway-related proteins and cytokines were determined by RT-qPCR, western blotting and ELISA, and the release of NO by Greiss reaction. RA rat models were constructed and the primary cells were classified into the control, negative control (NC), miR-146a mimic, miR-146a inhibitor, Tak-242, mimic + LPS, and TLR4 groups. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and intercellular adhesion molecular-1 (ICAM-1). The results showed that miR-146a levels were lower in RA-FLSs than control fibroblasts. miR-146a mimic and Tak-242 decreased RA-FLS proliferation and increased RA-FLS apoptosis, while miR-146a inhibitor had an opposite trend. miR-146a mimic and Tak-242 also decreased expression of TLR4, NF-κB, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, COX-2, MMP-3, Seprase, and iNOS, as well as reduced NO level in RA-FLSs while miR-146a inhibitor and TLR4 increased them. TLR4 and NF-κB levels and the positive rates of PCNA and ICAM-1 expressions were lower in RA-FLSs from RA rats given miR-146a mimic from control or miR-146a inhibitor-treated rats. These results suggest that miR-146a inhibits the proliferation and inflammatory response of RA-FLSs by down-regulating TLR4/NF-κB pathway.

--- Paper 5: Cichoric Acid Ameliorates Monosodium Urate-Induced Inflammatory Response by Reducing NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation via Inhibition of NF-kB Signaling Pathway ---
Gouty arthritis is characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) within synovial joints and tissues due to increased urate concentrations. Here, we elucidated the role of the natural compound cichoric acid (CA) on the MSU crystal-stimulated inflammatory response. The THP-1-derived macrophages (THP-Ms) were pretreated with CA and then stimulated with MSU suspensions. The protein levels of p65 and IκBα, the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway by measuring the expression of its downstream inflammatory cytokines, and the activity of NLRP3 inflammasome were measured by western blotting and ELISA. CA treatment markedly inhibited the degradation of IκBα and the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway and reduced the levels of its downstream inflammatory genes such as IL-1β, TNF-α, COX-2, and PGE2 in the MSU-stimulated THP-M cells. Therefore, we infer that CA effectively alleviated MSU-induced inflammation by suppressing the degradation of IκBα, thereby reducing the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway and the NLRP3 inflammasome. These results suggest that CA could be a novel therapeutic strategy in averting acute episodes of gout.

The NF-kB pathway is recognized as a crucial contributor to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and recent studies have illustrated how specific microRNAs (miRNAs) can downregulate this pathway. For instance, HAND2-AS1 has been found to interact with miR-143-3p, effectively inactivating the NF-kB pathway, which leads to suppressed activation and inflammation in RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) (Mesenchymal stem cell-originated exosomal lncRNA HAND2-AS1 impairs rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocyte activation through miR-143-3p/TNFAIP3/NF-κB pathway). Similarly, miR-146a was shown to inhibit RA-FLS proliferation and inflammatory responses by targeting the TLR4/NF-kB signaling pathway, indicating that miRNA-mediated regulation has strong therapeutic potential (MicroRNA-146a suppresses rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes proliferation and inflammatory responses by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-kB signaling). These findings suggest that enhancing specific miRNAs could be a promising strategy for modulating the NF-kB signaling pathway in RA treatment. However, a knowledge gap remains concerning the comprehensive mechanisms through which other miRNAs may regulate this pathway, as the functional roles of various miRNAs need to be further elucidated for potential therapeutic applications (A20‐Binding Inhibitor of NF‐κB Activation 1 Is a Physiologic Inhibitor of NF‐κB: A Molecular Switch for Inflammation and Autoimmunity). Exploring the influence of additional miRNAs on the NF-kB pathway could yield novel insights and therapeutic targets for managing RA inflammation.

--- Paper 1: LncRNA linc00152/NF‐κB feedback loop promotes fibroblast‐like synovial cells inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis via regulating miR‐103a/TAK1 axis and YY1 expression ---
Introduction: Overexpressed inflammatory cytokines are the main factors causing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) tissue damage and pathological deterioration, and lncRNAs has found to beinvolved in some autoinflammatory diseases. Methods: We designed this study to investigate the effect of lncRNA linc00152 on rheumatoid arthritis inflammation and explore its molecular mechanism.Result: We found that linc00152 was not only up‐regulated in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast‐like synoviocytes (RAFLS), but also stimulated by TNF‐α/IL‐1β in adose‐ and time‐dependent manner in RAFLS and this expression depends on the NF‐κB signaling pathway. Conversely, linc00152 promoted TNF‐α/IL‐1β expression in RAFLS induced by TNF‐α/IL‐1β. In addition, we found that linc00152 promoted TAK1 expression by targeting inhibition of miR‐103a and activated TAK1‐mediated NF‐κB pathway. NF‐kB indirectly promotes linc00152 expression by promoting the transcription activity of YY1, and YY1 directly promotes linc00152 expression by binding the promoter of linc00152. Conclusion: Our data suggested that the linc00152/NF‐κB feedback loop promotes RAFLS inflammation via regulating miR‐103a/TAK1 axis and YY1 expression. Thus, linc00152 acts as a switch to control this regulatory circuit and may serve as a diagnostic and therapeutic target for RA treatment.

--- Paper 2: Combined treatment with sinomenine and acupuncture on collagen-induced arthritis through the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathway. ---
Sinomenine is a monomer extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine plant Sabia japonica, which possesses several pharmacological properties including prominent abirritation, mitigation, anti-inflammation, immune suppression, cough relief, stimulation of histamine release, decrease in blood pressure and antiarrhythmia. Sinomenine is clinically employed to treat rheumatic disease. To investigate the impact of combined sinomenine treatment with acupuncture on the progression of arthritis and explore the potential underlying molecular mechanisms, the present study analyzed a collagen-induced arthritis model. Results from the combined curative (CC) treatment group (combined treatment with sinomenine and acupuncture) demonstrated a decrease in volume changes and arthritis score changes within rat paws, and increased the overall body weight in arthritic rats. CC treatment significantly decreased tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and IL-8 serum levels in arthritic rats. CC treatment significantly increased superoxide dismutase and inhibited malondialdehyde levels in arthritic rats. The protein expression of cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and MMP9 in arthritic rats was suppressed owing to CC treatment. Finally, nuclear factor κB and phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) protein expression in arthritic rats were also suppressed following CC treatment. The results indicate that the combined treatment of sinomenine and acupuncture on collagen-induced arthritis takes effect through the nuclear factor κB and MAPK signaling pathway.

--- Paper 3: Epimedium sagittatum inhibits TLR4/MD-2 mediated NF-κB signaling pathway with anti-inflammatory activity ---
BackgroundEpimedium sagittatum (Sieb.et Zucc.) Maxim., Ying-Yang-Huo in Chinese has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine and is deemed to “reinforce the kidney Yang”. Previous studies showed that E. sagittatum could modulate the immune system and treat some chronic disease such as rheumatic arthritis, cardiovascular diseases and osteoporosis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of ethyl acetate extracts (YYHs) of E. sagittatum and its mechanisms of action.MethodsIn order to explore the composition of YYHs, YYHs was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and in comparison with reference standards. Anti-inflammatory model was established in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. The levels of nitric oxide (NO) were measured with the Griess reagent. Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). In addition, expression of p-p65 protein and TLR4/MD-2 complex was detected by western blots and flow cytometric, respectively. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) nuclear translocation was observed by fluorescence microscope.ResultsA total of eight compounds were identified, of which icariside II was the most abundant compound. YYHs (12.5–50 μg/mL) had no obvious cytotoxic effect on cells, and remarkably inhibited LPS-induced production of NO, TNF-α and IL-2 with a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, YYHs up-regulated expression of p-p65 and TLR4/MD-2 complex. Further research showed that YYHs significantly suppressed NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation.ConclusionIn brief, YYHs contributed to the inhibition of LPS-induced inflammatory response through the TLR4/MD-2-mediated NF-κB pathway and may be a potential choice to combat inflammation diseases.Abstract graphIt includes a schema of pathways at the end of the paper.

--- Paper 4: Differential expression of microRNAs let‐7a, miR‐125b, miR‐100, and miR‐21 and interaction with NF‐kB pathway genes in periodontitis pathogenesis ---
Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease which is caused by destruction of the tissues that surrounds and supports the tooth. Deregulation of microRNAs has been reported to cause several inflammatory diseases such as autoimmune disease, chronic periodontitis, and cancer. In the present study, we have investigated the expression pattern of microRNAs let‐7a, miR‐125b, miR‐100, miR‐21, and RNA‐binding protein LIN‐28A among healthy individuals and chronic periodontitis patients. Total RNA was isolated from gingival tissue samples collected from 100 healthy individuals and 100 chronic periodontitis patients. The expression of microRNAs and LIN‐28 was performed by qPCR. Target prediction for the microRNAs was done using miRWalk and miRTarbase online databases and the experimentally validated targets were analyzed for their molecular function, biological processes, and related pathways using gProfiler software. The expression analysis revealed that let‐7a and miR‐21 were upregulated, whereas, miR‐100, miR‐125b, and LIN‐28 were down regulated. The age dependent expression analysis revealed that the expression levels of all the microRNAs and LIN‐28 were found to increase with age (more than 50 years), thereby suggesting an increased risk to chronic periodontitis. Among the various targets predicted using miRWalk and miRTarbase databases, NFKB was found to be a common target among all the four microRNAs. gProfiler revealed several functions such as NF‐ĸB signaling pathway, cytokine‐cytokine receptor interaction, osteoclast differentiation, etc., all of which specific to inflammation and periodontitis.

--- Paper 5: Inflammation-targeted celastrol nanodrug attenuates collagen-induced arthritis through NF-κB and Notch1 pathways. ---
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disorder which can cause cartilage and bone damage leading to disability, yet the treatment remains unsatisfactory nowadays. Celastrol (Cel) has shown anti-rheumatic activity against RA. However, the frequent parenteral delivery and poor water solubility of Cel restricts its further therapeutic applications. Here, aiming at effectively overcome the poor water solubility and short half-life of Cel to boost its beneficial effects for treating RA, we developed a polymeric micelle for Cel delivery based on a reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensitive polymer. Our results demonstrated that Cel may inhibit the re-polarization of macrophages toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype via regulating the NF-κB and Notch1 pathways, which resulted in significantly decreased secretion of multiple inflammatory cytokines to suppress the RA progression. Consequently, the Cel-loaded micelle effectively alleviated the major RA-associated symptoms including articular scores, ankle thickness, synovial inflammation, bone erosion, cartilage degradation.

The NF-kB pathway is implicated in the inflammatory processes associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as demonstrated by various studies. For instance, the lncRNA linc00152 has been shown to activate the NF-kB pathway through the regulation of miR-103a, promoting inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RAFLS) (Zhang et al., Immunity, Inflammation and Disease, 2021). Conversely, interventions such as the combined treatment of sinomenine and acupuncture were effective in downregulating the NF-kB pathway and subsequently reducing inflammatory cytokine levels in collagen-induced arthritis (Xu et al., Oncology Letters, 2018). Moreover, another study highlighted that the modulation of microRNAs, specifically miR-21, miR-100, and miR-125b, interacts with NF-kB pathway genes, indicating a potential role for targeting these miRNAs to alleviate inflammation in related conditions (Venugopal et al., Journal of Cellular Physiology, 2018). These findings suggest that enhancing the expression or function of specific miRNAs could represent a novel therapeutic strategy to downregulate NF-kB-mediated inflammation in RA, warranting further exploration of the miRNA-NF-kB cascade in the context of RA (An et al., Nano Letters, 2020). Notably, gaps exist in understanding the precise mechanisms by which other identified miRNAs can be effectively modulated to influence NF-kB activity and their overall impact on therapeutic outcomes in RA.

--- Paper 1: Changes in expression of membrane TNF, NF-κB activation and neutrophil apoptosis during active and resolved inflammation ---
Background Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is central to the pathophysiological process of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), whether as soluble cytokine or membrane-expressed pro-TNF (mTNF). Objectives To determine whether neutrophils, which can express TNF, are activated in the blood of patients with RA compared with healthy controls. To investigate, by focusing on mTNF expression, if the functions of RA neutrophils change in response to therapeutic TNF inhibition. Methods TNF was measured by flow cytometry and qPCR in neutrophils from 20 patients with RA before and after the start of TNF inhibitor therapy. Apoptosis was measured by morphology, and western blotting of pro- and antiapoptotic proteins in cell lysates. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation was determined by western blotting of phosphorylated NF-κB (p65). Results Before treatment RA neutrophils exhibited increased TNF mRNA expression, elevated mTNF levels and NF-κB activity compared with controls. They also underwent delayed apoptosis as shown by altered expression of anti- and proapoptotic proteins, such as Mcl-1 and caspases. Neutrophil TNF expression returned to baseline levels during successful treatment with anti-TNF biological agents, and there was a close correlation between clinical disease improvement and changes in neutrophil function. Conclusions Neutrophils express elevated levels of TNF in RA and the transcription factor, NF-κB, a target of TNF, is activated. This mechanism could lead to a self-sustained inflammatory process. These data point to an important role of neutrophils in the abnormal TNF signalling pathways activated in RA and provide new evidence that neutrophils actively contribute to altered cytokine signalling in inflammatory diseases.

--- Paper 2: High mobility group box 1 potentiates the pro-inflammatory effects of interleukin-1β in osteoarthritic synoviocytes ---
IntroductionHigh mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is released by necrotic cells or secreted in response to inflammatory stimuli. Extracellular HMGB1 may act as a pro-inflammatory cytokine in rheumatoid arthritis. We have recently reported that HMGB1 is released by osteoarthritic synoviocytes after activation with interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) The present study investigated the role of HMGB1 in synovial inflammation in osteoarthritis (OA).MethodsHMGB1 was determined in human synovium using immunohistochemistry, comparing normal to OA. OA synoviocytes were incubated with HMGB1 at 15 or 25 ng/ml in the absence or presence of IL-1β (10 ng/ml). Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative PCR and protein expression by Western Blot and ELISA. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity was studied by fluorometric procedures and nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation by transient transfection with a NF-κB-luciferase plasmid.ResultsIn the normal synovium, HMGB1 was found in the synovial lining cells, sublining cells, and in the vascular wall cells. The distribution of HMGB1 in OA synovium was similar but the number of HMGB1 positive cells was higher and HMGB1 was also present in infiltrated cells. In normal synovial membrane cells, HMGB1 was found mostly in the nuclei, whereas in OA, HMGB1 was generally found mostly in the cytoplasm. In OA synoviocytes, HMGB1 alone at concentrations of 15 or 25 ng/ml did not affect the production of IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, CCL20, MMP-1 or MMP-3, but in the presence of IL-1β, a significant potentiation of protein and mRNA expression, as well as MMP activity was observed. HMGB1 also enhanced the phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38 levels, with a lower effect on phosphorylated Akt. In contrast, JNK1/2 phosphorylation was not affected. In addition, HMGB1 at 25 ng/ml significantly potentiated NF-κB activation in the presence of IL-1β.ConclusionsOur results indicate that HMGB1 is overexpressed in OA synovium and mostly present in extracellular form. In OA synoviocytes, HMGB1 cooperates with IL-1β to amplify the inflammatory response leading to the production of a number of cytokines, chemokines and MMPs. Our data support a pro-inflammatory role for this protein contributing to synovitis and articular destruction in OA.

--- Paper 3: Long Non-coding RNA HIX003209 Promotes Inflammation by Sponging miR-6089 via TLR4/NF-κB Signaling Pathway in Rheumatoid Arthritis ---
Accumulating studies have suggested that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have drawn more and more attention in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which can function as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) in inflammation and immune disorders. Previously, we have found that lncRNA HIX003209 is differentially expressed in RA. However, the precise mechanism of lncRNA HIX003209 in RA is still vague. We aim to elucidate the role and its targeted microRNA of lncRNA HIX003209 in RA as ceRNA. Significantly increased expression of lncRNA HIX003209 was observed in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA cases. It was positively associated with TLR2 and TLR4 in RA. Besides, peptidoglycan (PGN) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) could enhance the expression of lncRNA HIX003209, which reversely promoted the proliferation and activation of macrophages through IκBα/NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, HIX003209 was involved in TLR4-mediated inflammation via targeting miR-6089 in macrophages. LncRNA HIX003209 functions as a ceRNA and exaggerates inflammation by sponging miR-6089 through TLR4/NF-κB pathway in macrophages, which offers promising therapeutic strategies for RA.

--- Paper 4: Genistein suppresses tumor necrosis factor α-induced inflammation via modulating reactive oxygen species/Akt/nuclear factor κB and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signal pathways in human synoviocyte MH7A cells ---
Aims Genistein, an isoflavone derivative found in soy, is known as a promising treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the detailed molecular mechanism of genistein in suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production remains ambiguous. The aim of this work was to evaluate the signal pathway by which genistein modulates inflammatory cytokine expression. Materials and methods MH7A cells were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and incubated with genistein, and interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB was measured by a confocal fluorescence microscopy. The intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was monitored using the fluorescent probe 5-6-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. Signal-transduction protein expression was measured by Western blot. Results Genistein decreased the secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 from TNF-α-stimulated MH7A cells in a dose-dependent manner. Genistein prevented TNF-α-induced NF-κB translocation as well as phosphorylation of IκB kinase-α/β and IκBα, and also suppressed TNF-α-induced AMPK inhibition. The production of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 induced by TNF-α was decreased by the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitor LY294002, suggesting that inhibition of Akt activation might inhibit IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 production induced by TNF-α. In addition, we also found that pretreatment with the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) agonist 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside obviously inhibited TNF-α-induced proinflammatory cytokine production. These observations suggest that the inhibitory effect of genistein on TNF-α-induced proinflammatory cytokine production is dependent on AMPK activation. Conclusion These findings indicate that genistein suppressed TNF-α-induced inflammation by inhibiting the ROS/Akt/NF-κB pathway and promoting AMPK activation in MH7A cells.

--- Paper 5: Cells of the synovium in rheumatoid arthritis. Dendritic cells ---
Dendritic cells are the major antigen-presenting and antigen-priming cells of the immune system. We review the antigen-presenting and proinflammatory roles played by dendritic cells in the initiation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and atherosclerosis, which complicates RA. Various signals that promote the activation of NF-κB and the secretion of TNF and IL-1 drive the maturation of dendritic cells to prime self-specific responses, and drive the perpetuation of synovial inflammation. These signals may include genetic factors, infection, cigarette smoking, immunostimulatory DNA and oxidized low-density lipoprotein, with major involvement of autoantibodies. We propose that the pathogenesis of RA and atherosclerosis is intimately linked, with the vascular disease of RA driven by similar and simultaneous triggers to NF-κB.

The NF-κB pathway plays a critical role in the inflammatory processes associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which may impact the effectiveness of novel therapeutic approaches. Notably, elevated NF-κB activation in RA neutrophils corresponds with increased TNF expression, suggesting that this pathway contributes to ongoing inflammation and self-sustained cytokine signaling (Changes in expression of membrane TNF, NF-κB activation and neutrophil apoptosis during active and resolved inflammation). Additionally, the long non-coding RNA HIX003209 enhances inflammation by engaging the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in RA macrophages, indicating a potential therapeutic target to modulate this inflammatory response (Long Non-coding RNA HIX003209 Promotes Inflammation by Sponging miR-6089 via TLR4/NF-κB Signaling Pathway in Rheumatoid Arthritis). Moreover, interventions like genistein appear to mitigate TNF-α-induced inflammatory responses by inhibiting NF-κB activation, illustrating how modulation of this pathway could ameliorate RA symptoms (Genistein suppresses tumor necrosis factor α-induced inflammation via modulating reactive oxygen species/Akt/nuclear factor κB and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signal pathways in human synoviocyte MH7A cells). These findings collectively underscore the pivotal role of NF-κB in RA pathophysiology, presenting avenues for future research into targeted therapies that disrupt inflammatory signaling cascades. Research gaps remain in understanding how various therapeutic agents can differentially modulate NF-κB activity and the implications for RA treatment efficacy.

--- Paper 1: A novel NF-κB/YY1/microRNA-10a regulatory circuit in fibroblast-like synoviocytes regulates inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis ---
The main etiopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is overexpressed inflammatory cytokines and tissue injury mediated by persistent NF-κB activation. MicroRNAs widely participate in the regulation of target gene expression and play important roles in various diseases. Here, we explored the mechanisms of microRNAs in RA. We found that microRNA (miR)-10a was downregulated in the fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) of RA patients compared with osteoarthritis (OA) controls and this downregulation could be triggered by TNF-α and IL-1β in an NF-κB-dependent manner through promoting the expression of the YingYang 1 (YY1) transcription factor. Downregulated miR-10a could accelerate IκB degradation and NF-κB activation by targeting IRAK4, TAK1 and BTRC. This miR-10a-mediated NF-κB activation then significantly promoted the production of various inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and MMP-13. In addition, transfection of a miR-10a inhibitor accelerated the proliferation and migration of FLSs. Collectively, our data demonstrates the existence of a novel NF-κB/YY1/miR-10a/NF-κB regulatory circuit that promotes the excessive secretion of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory cytokines and the proliferation and migration of RA FLSs. Thus, miR-10a acts as a switch to control this regulatory circuit and may serve as a diagnostic and therapeutic target for RA treatment.

--- Paper 2: NF-kappaB in rheumatoid arthritis: a pivotal regulator of inflammation, hyperplasia, and tissue destruction ---
The transcription factor NF-κB has been well recognized as a pivotal regulator of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but recent developments revealed a broad involvement of NF-κB in other aspects of RA pathology, including development of T helper 1 responses, activation, abnormal apoptosis and proliferation of RA fibroblast-like synovial cells, and differentiation and activation of bone resorbing activity of osteoclasts. In agreement with this, studies in animal models of RA have demonstrated the high therapeutic efficacy of specific inhibitors of NF-κB pathway, indicating the feasibility of anti-NF-κB therapy for human disease.

--- Paper 3: Treatment with recombinant interferon-β reduces inflammation and slows cartilage destruction in the collagen-induced arthritis model of rheumatoid arthritis ---
We investigated the therapeutic potential and mechanism of action of IFN-β protein for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Collagen-induced arthritis was induced in DBA/1 mice. At the first clinical sign of disease, mice were given daily injections of recombinant mouse IFN-β or saline for 7 days. Disease progression was monitored by visual clinical scoring and measurement of paw swelling. Inflammation and joint destruction were assessed histologically 8 days after the onset of arthritis. Proteoglycan depletion was determined by safranin O staining. Expression of cytokines, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand, and c-Fos was evaluated immunohistochemically. The IL-1-induced expression of IL-6, IL-8, and granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was studied by ELISA in supernatant of RA and osteoarthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes incubated with IFN-β. We also examined the effect of IFN-β on NF-κB activity. IFN-β, at 0.25 μg/injection and higher, significantly reduced disease severity in two experiments, each using 8–10 mice per treatment group. IFN-β-treated animals displayed significantly less cartilage and bone destruction than controls, paralleled by a decreased number of positive cells of two gene products required for osteoclastogenesis, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand and c-Fos. Tumor necrosis factor α and IL-6 expression were significantly reduced, while IL-10 production was increased after IFN-β treatment. IFN-β reduced expression of IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF in RA and osteoarthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes, correlating with reduced NF-κB activity. The data support the view that IFN-β is a potential therapy for RA that might help to diminish both joint inflammation and destruction by cytokine modulation.

--- Paper 4: Curcumin mediated suppression of nuclear factor-κB promotes chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells in a high-density co-culture microenvironment ---
IntroductionOsteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are characterised by joint inflammation and cartilage degradation. Although mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like progenitors are resident in the superficial zone of articular cartilage, damaged tissue does not possess the capacity for regeneration. The high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines present in OA/RA joints may impede the chondrogenic differentiation of these progenitors. Interleukin (IL)-1β activates the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which in turn activates proteins involved in matrix degradation, inflammation and apoptosis. Curcumin is a phytochemical capable of inhibiting IL-1β-induced activation of NF-κB and expression of apoptotic and pro-inflammatory genes in chondrocytes. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of curcumin on IL-1β-induced NF-κB signalling pathway in MSCs during chondrogenic differentiation.MethodsMSCs were either cultured in a ratio of 1:1 with primary chondrocytes in high-density culture or cultured alone in monolayer with/without curcumin and/or IL-1β.ResultsWe demonstrate that although curcumin alone does not have chondrogenic effects on MSCs, it inhibits IL-1β-induced activation of NF-κB, activation of caspase-3 and cyclooxygenase-2 in MSCs time and concentration dependently, as it does in chondrocytes. In IL-1β stimulated co-cultures, four-hour pre-treatment with curcumin significantly enhanced the production of collagen type II, cartilage specific proteoglycans (CSPGs), β1-integrin, as well as activating MAPKinase signaling and suppressing caspase-3 and cyclooxygenase-2.ConclusionsCurcumin treatment may help establish a microenvironment in which the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines are antagonized, thus facilitating chondrogenesis of MSC-like progenitor cells in vivo. This strategy may support the regeneration of articular cartilage.

--- Paper 5: Molecular Hydrogen: New Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory Therapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis and Related Diseases ---
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease in which the progressive destruction of joint causes morbidity. It is also associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis, which can result in cardiovascular disease and mortality. The therapeutic goal is to control the systemic inflammation to obtain not only the remission of symptoms, but also improve general state of health. Although recent biologic immunosuppressive therapies targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines have spawned a paradigm shift regarding the prognosis of RA, these therapies possess inherent side effects. Also, early diagnosis of the disease remains confounded by uncertainty. While the mechanisms responsible for the onset of RA remain unclear, reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a significant role in the pathogenesis of RA. ROS play a central role both upstream and downstream of NF-κB and TNFα pathways, which are located at the center of the inflammatory response. Among the ROS, the hydroxyl radical is the most harmful, and molecular hydrogen (H2) is a selective scavenger for this species. Recently, it has been shown that H2 is useful when administered along with the conventional therapy in RA as it acts to reduce oxidative stress in the patients. Especially in the early stage, H2 showed significant therapeutic potential, which also seemed to assist diagnosis and treatment decisions of RA. The possible expectations regarding the potential benefits of H2 by reducing the oxidative stress, resulting from inflammatory factors, are raised and discussed here. They include prevention of RA and related atherosclerosis, as well as therapeutic validity for RA

The NF-κB pathway is recognized as a central regulator of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with persistent NF-κB activation contributing to the disease's pathogenesis through the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines (Makarov, "NF-kappaB in rheumatoid arthritis: a pivotal regulator of inflammation, hyperplasia, and tissue destruction"). Inhibitors of the NF-κB pathway have shown high therapeutic efficacy in animal models, suggesting a potential for anti-NF-κB therapies in human RA (Makarov, "NF-kappaB in rheumatoid arthritis: a pivotal regulator of inflammation, hyperplasia, and tissue destruction"). The novel NF-κB/YY1/miR-10a regulatory circuit identified in fibroblast-like synoviocytes showcases how microRNAs may mediate NF-κB activity and inflammatory cytokine secretion in RA, highlighting potential targets for therapeutic intervention (Mu et al., "A novel NF-κB/YY1/microRNA-10a regulatory circuit in fibroblast-like synoviocytes regulates inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis"). Additionally, molecular hydrogen, acting as an antioxidant, could modulate oxidative stress related to NF-κB and TNFα pathways, suggesting a novel approach for enhancing therapeutic outcomes in RA (Ishibashi, "Molecular Hydrogen: New Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory Therapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis and Related Diseases"). The combination of these findings indicates the viability of targeting the NF-κB pathway through various modalities, including the modulation of microRNAs and oxidative stress, to improve therapeutic efficacy in RA. Overall, these insights reveal the complexity of NF-κB interactions with inflammation and suggest that novel therapeutic approaches could be geared towards more precise modulation of this pathway.

--- Paper 1: Local treatment with the selective IκB kinase β inhibitor NEMO-binding domain peptide ameliorates synovial inflammation ---
Nuclear factor (NF)-κB is a key regulator of synovial inflammation. We investigated the effect of local NF-κB inhibition in rat adjuvant arthritis (AA), using the specific IκB kinase (IKK)-β blocking NF-κB essential modulator-binding domain (NBD) peptide. The effects of the NBD peptide on human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and macrophages, as well as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) whole-tissue biopsies, were also evaluated. First, we investigated the effects of the NBD peptide on RA FLS in vitro. Subsequently, NBD peptides were administered intra-articularly into the right ankle joint of rats at the onset of disease. The severity of arthritis was monitored over time, rats were sacrificed on day 20, and tissue specimens were collected for routine histology and x-rays of the ankle joints. Human macrophages or RA synovial tissues were cultured ex vivo in the presence or absence of NBD peptides, and cytokine production was measured in the supernatant by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The NBD peptide blocked interleukin (IL)-1-β-induced IκBα phosphorylation and IL-6 production in RA FLS. Intra-articular injection of the NBD peptide led to significantly reduced severity of arthritis (p < 0.0001) and reduced radiological damage (p = 0.04). This was associated with decreased synovial cellularity and reduced expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1-β in the synovium. Incubation of human macrophages with NBD peptides resulted in 50% inhibition of IL-1-β-induced TNF-α production in the supernatant (p < 0.01). In addition, the NBD peptide decreased TNF-α-induced IL-6 production by human RA synovial tissue biopsies by approximately 42% (p < 0.01). Specific NF-κB blockade using a small peptide inhibitor of IKK-β has anti-inflammatory effects in AA and human RA synovial tissue as well as in two important cell types in the pathogenesis of RA: macrophages and FLS. These results indicate that IKK-β-targeted NF-κB blockade using the NBD peptide could offer a new approach for the local treatment of arthritis.

--- Paper 2: JNK pathway is involved in the inhibition of inflammatory target gene expression and NF-kappaB activation by melittin ---
BackgroundBee venom therapy has been used to treat inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis in humans and in experimental animals. We previously found that bee venom and melittin (a major component of bee venom) have anti-inflammatory effect by reacting with the sulfhydryl group of p50 of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and IκB kinases (IKKs). Since mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase family is implicated in the NF-κB activation and inflammatory reaction, we further investigated whether activation of MAP kinase may be also involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of melittin and bee venom.MethodsThe anti-inflammatory effects of melittin and bee venom were investigated in cultured Raw 264.7 cells, THP-1 human monocytic cells and Synoviocytes. The activation of NF-κB was investigated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were determined either by Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay or by biochemical assay. Expression of IκB, p50, p65, inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) as well as phosphorylation of MAP kinase family was determined by Western blot.ResultsMelittin (0.5–5 μg/ml) and bee venom (5 and 10 μg/ml) inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 μg/ml) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 200 μM)-induced activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) in RAW 264.7 cells in a dose dependent manner. However, JNK inhibitor, anthra [1,9-cd]pyrazole-6 (2H)-one (SP600215, 10–50 μM) dose dependently suppressed the inhibitory effects of melittin and bee venom on NF-κB dependent luciferase and DNA binding activity via suppression of the inhibitory effect of melittin and bee venom on the LPS and SNP-induced translocation of p65 and p50 into nucleus as well as cytosolic release of IκB. Moreover, JNK inhibitor suppressed the inhibitory effects of melittin and bee venom on iNOS and COX-2 expression, and on NO and PGE2 generation.ConclusionThese data show that melittin and bee venom prevent LPS and SNP-induced NO and PGE2 production via JNK pathway dependent inactivation of NF-κB, and suggest that inactivation of JNK pathways may also contribute to the anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritis effects of melittin and bee venom.

--- Paper 3: A2A and A3 adenosine receptor expression in rheumatoid arthritis: upregulation, inverse correlation with disease activity score and suppression of inflammatory cytokine and metalloproteinase release ---
IntroductionThe reduction of the inflammatory status represents one of the most important targets in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A central role of A2A and A3 adenosine receptors (ARs) in mechanisms of inflammation has been reported in different pathologies. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the A2A and A3ARs and their involvement in RA progression measured by Disease Activity Score in 28 or 44 joints (DAS28 or DAS).MethodsARs were analyzed by saturation binding assays, mRNA and Western blotting analysis in lymphocytes from early and established RA patients. The effect of A2A and A3AR agonists in nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) pathway was evaluated. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) release was carried out by A2A and A3AR activation. AR pharmacological regulation in matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) release was also studied.ResultsIn lymphocytes obtained from RA patients, A2A and A3ARs were up-regulated if compared with healthy controls. A2A and A3AR activation inhibited the NF-kB pathway and diminished inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. A2A and A3AR agonists mediated a reduction of MMP-1 and MMP-3 release. A2A and A3AR density inversely correlated with DAS28 and DAS suggesting a direct role of the endogenous activation of these receptors in the control of RA joint inflammation.ConclusionsTaken together these data demonstrate that the inflammatory and clinical responses in RA are regulated by A2A and A3ARs and support the use of A2A and/or A3AR agonists as novel and effective pharmacological treatment in RA patients.

--- Paper 4: Non-canonical NF-κB signaling in rheumatoid arthritis: Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde? ---
The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) family of transcription factors is essential for the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but can also induce regulatory pathways. NF-κB can be activated via two distinct pathways: the classical or canonical pathway, and the alternative or non-canonical pathway. It is well established that the canonical NF-κB pathway is essential both in acute inflammatory responses and in chronic inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although less extensively studied, the non-canonical NF-κB pathway is not only central in lymphoid organ development and adaptive immune responses, but is also thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of RA. Importantly, this pathway appears to have cell type-specific functions and, since many different cell types are involved in the pathogenesis of RA, it is difficult to predict the net overall contribution of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway to synovial inflammation. In this review, we describe the current understanding of non-canonical NF-κB signaling in various important cell types in the context of RA and consider the relevance to the pathogenesis of the disease. In addition, we discuss current drugs targeting this pathway, as well as future therapeutic prospects.

--- Paper 5: IL-17 induces production of IL-6 and IL-8 in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts via NF-κB- and PI3-kinase/Akt-dependent pathways ---
Recent studies of the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have revealed that both synovial fibroblasts and T cells participate in the perpetuation of joint inflammation as dynamic partners in a mutual activation feedback, via secretion of cytokines and chemokines that stimulate each other. In this study, we investigated the role of IL-17, a major Th1 cytokine produced by activated T cells, in the activation of RA synovial fibroblasts. Transcripts of IL-17R (IL-17 receptor) and IL-17RB (IL-17 receptor B) were present in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) of RA patients. IL-17R responded with increased expression upon in vitro stimulation with IL-17, while the level of IL-17RB did not change. IL-17 enhanced the production of IL-6 and IL-8 in FLS, as previously shown, but did not affect the synthesis of IL-15. IL-17 appears to be a stronger inducer of IL-6 and IL-8 than IL-15, and even exerted activation comparable to that of IL-1β in RA FLS. IL-17-mediated induction of IL-6 and IL-8 was transduced via activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and NF-κB, while CD40 ligation and p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) are not likely to partake in the process. Together these results suggest that IL-17 is capable of more than accessory roles in the activation of RA FLS and provide grounds for targeting IL-17-associated pathways in therapeutic modulation of arthritis inflammation.

The NF-κB pathway plays a crucial role in promoting inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and has been a focus for novel therapeutic strategies. Specific inhibition of IκB kinase β, using the NEMO-binding domain peptide, demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects by reducing cytokine production (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6) and improving arthritis severity in both rat models and human RA synovial tissue (Local treatment with the selective IκB kinase β inhibitor NEMO-binding domain peptide ameliorates synovial inflammation; S. Tas et al., Arthritis Research & Therapy, 2006). Additionally, A2A and A3 adenosine receptor activation showed potential to inhibit the NF-κB pathway, correlating with a decrease in inflammatory markers and suggesting that adenosine receptor agonists may serve as effective therapeutic agents in RA management (A2A and A3 adenosine receptor expression in rheumatoid arthritis; K. Varani et al., Arthritis Research & Therapy, 2011). Contrarily, the non-canonical NF-κB pathways remain less understood, indicating a potential knowledge gap regarding their role in RA and suggesting that future therapeutic approaches should consider the complexity of NF-κB signaling, including both canonical and non-canonical pathways (Non-canonical NF-κB signaling in rheumatoid arthritis; A. Noort et al., Arthritis Research & Therapy, 2015). This highlights the need for further research into the interactions between different signaling pathways and their therapeutic implications in RA.

--- Paper 1: Roles of miR319 and TCP Transcription Factors in Leaf Development1[OPEN] ---
Combinations of mutations in miR319 and TCP transcription factor genes in Arabidopsis thaliana generate cotyledon fusion and various leaf forms with a broad range of complexity. Sophisticated regulation of gene expression, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes, is required for leaf differentiation, growth, and senescence. The impact of miR319 and its target TEOSINTE BRANCHED1, CYCLOIDEA, and PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN BINDING FACTOR (TCP) genes on leaf development has been extensively investigated, but the redundancies of these gene families often interfere with the evaluation of their function and regulation in the developmental context. Here, we present the genetic evidence of the involvement of the MIR319 and TCP gene families in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaf development. Single mutations in MIR319A and MIR319B genes moderately inhibited the formation of leaf serrations, whereas double mutations increased the extent of this inhibition and resulted in the formation of smooth leaves. Mutations in MIR319 and gain-of-function mutations in the TCP4 gene conferred resistance against miR319 and impaired the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. These mutations functionally associated with CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON genes, which regulate the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in miR319-targeted and nontargeted TCP genes cooperatively induced the formation of serrated leaves in addition to changes in the levels of their downstream gene transcript. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the MIR319 and TCP gene families underlie robust and multilayer control of leaf development. This study also provides a framework toward future researches on redundant miRNAs and transcription factors in Arabidopsis and crop plants.

--- Paper 2: MYC regulates the antitumor immune response through CD47 and PD-L1 ---
Oncogene control of antitumor immunity Recent clinical success of cancer immunotherapy has intensified interest in how tumors normally evade the immune response. Whether and how oncogenes contribute to this process are not well understood. In a study of mice, Casey et al. found that the MYC oncogene, which is aberrantly activated in many human cancers, up-regulates the expression of genes encoding proteins that dampen the antitumor response. These include two proteins that are often overexpressed on tumor cells and that serve as immune checkpoints. One of them (PDL1) sends to the immune system a “don't find me” signal, and the other (CD47) sends a “don't eat me” signal. Thus, therapies aimed at suppressing MYC may help promote an immune response against tumors. Science, this issue p. 227 Aberrant activation of the MYC gene helps tumor cells evade the immune response. The MYC oncogene codes for a transcription factor that is overexpressed in many human cancers. Here we show that MYC regulates the expression of two immune checkpoint proteins on the tumor cell surface: the innate immune regulator CD47 (cluster of differentiation 47) and the adaptive immune checkpoint PD-L1 (programmed death–ligand 1). Suppression of MYC in mouse tumors and human tumor cells caused a reduction in the levels of CD47 and PD-L1 messenger RNA and protein. MYC was found to bind directly to the promoters of the Cd47 and Pd-l1 genes. MYC inactivation in mouse tumors down-regulated CD47 and PD-L1 expression and enhanced the antitumor immune response. In contrast, when MYC was inactivated in tumors with enforced expression of CD47 or PD-L1, the immune response was suppressed, and tumors continued to grow. Thus, MYC appears to initiate and maintain tumorigenesis, in part, through the modulation of immune regulatory molecules.

--- Paper 3: MicroRNA-146a: A Dominant, Negative Regulator of the Innate Immune Response ---
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNA molecules that can play critical roles as regulators of numerous pathways and biological processes including the immune response. Emerging as one of the most important miRNAs to orchestrate immune and inflammatory signaling, often through its recognized target genes, IRAK1 and TRAF6, is microRNA-146a (miR-146a). MiR-146a is one, of a small number of miRNAs, whose expression is strongly induced following challenge of cells with bacterial endotoxin, and prolonged expression has been linked to immune tolerance, implying that it acts as a fine-tuning mechanism to prevent an overstimulation of the inflammatory response. In other cells, miR-146a has been shown to play a role in the control of the differentiation of megakaryocytic and monocytic lineages, adaptive immunity, and cancer. In this review, we discuss the central role prescribed to miR-146a in innate immunity. We particularly focus on the role played by miR-146a in the regulation and signaling mediated by one of the main pattern recognition receptors, toll/IL-1 receptors (TLRs). Additionally, we also discuss the role of miR-146a in several classes of autoimmune pathologies where this miRNA has been shown to be dysregulated, as well as its potential role in the pathobiology of neurodegenerative diseases.

--- Paper 4: Let-7 miRNAs target the lineage-specific transcription factor PLZF to regulate terminal NKT cell differentiation and effector function ---
Lethal-7 (let-7) microRNAs (miRNAs) are the most abundant miRNAs in the genome, but their role in developing thymocytes is unclear. We found that let-7 miRNAs targeted Zbtb16 mRNA, which encodes the lineage-specific transcription factor PLZF, to post-transcriptionally regulate PLZF expression and thereby the effector functions of natural killer T cells (NKT cells). Dynamic upregulation of let-7 miRNAs during the development of NKT thymocytes downregulated PLZF expression and directed their terminal differentiation into interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-producing NKT1 cells. Without upregulation of let-7 miRNAs, NKT thymocytes maintained high PLZF expression and terminally differentiated into interleukin 4 (IL-4)-producing NKT2 cells or IL-17-producing NKT17 cells. Upregulation of let-7 miRNAs in developing NKT thymocytes was signaled by IL-15, vitamin D and retinoic acid. Such targeting of a lineage-specific transcription factor by miRNA represents a previously unknown level of developmental regulation in the thymus.

--- Paper 5: Control of regulatory T‐cell differentiation and function by T‐cell receptor signalling and Foxp3 transcription factor complexes ---
The transcription factor Foxp3 controls the differentiation and function of regulatory T‐cells (Treg). Studies in the past decades identified numerous Foxp3‐interacting protein partners. However, it is still not clear how Foxp3 produces the Treg‐type transcriptomic landscape through cooperating with its partners. Here I show the current understanding of how Foxp3 transcription factor complexes regulate the differentiation, maintenance and functional maturation of Treg. Importantly, T‐cell receptor (TCR) signalling plays central roles in Treg differentiation and Foxp3‐mediated gene regulation. Differentiating Treg will have recognized their cognate antigens and received TCR signals before initiating Foxp3 transcription, which is triggered by TCR‐induced transcription factors including NFAT, AP‐1 and NF‐κB. Once expressed, Foxp3 seizes TCR signal‐induced transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms through interacting with AML1/Runx1 and NFAT. Thus, Foxp3 modifies gene expression dynamics of TCR‐induced genes, which constitute cardinal mechanisms for Treg‐mediated immune suppression. Next, I discuss the following key topics, proposing new mechanistic models for Foxp3‐mediated gene regulation: (i) how Foxp3 transcription is induced and maintained by the Foxp3‐inducing enhanceosome and the Foxp3 autoregulatory transcription factor complex; (ii) molecular mechanisms for effector Treg differentiation (i.e. Treg maturation); (iii) how Foxp3 activates or represses its target genes through recruiting coactivators and corepressors; (iv) the ‘decision‐making’ Foxp3‐containing transcription factor complex for Th17 and Treg differentiation; and (v) the roles of post‐translational modification in Foxp3 regulation. Thus, this article provides cutting‐edge understanding of molecular biology of Foxp3 and Treg, integrating findings by biochemical and genomic studies.

The relationship between microRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors involved in immune response regulation and immune cell differentiation is exemplified by several key findings across multiple studies. For instance, microRNA-146a (miR-146a) emerges as a significant regulator of the innate immune response, acting to control the expression of key signaling molecules such as IRAK1 and TRAF6, which are essential for immune cell differentiation (Saba, R., et al. (2014). MicroRNA-146a: A Dominant, Negative Regulator of the Innate Immune Response. Frontiers in Immunology). Moreover, the study by Pobezinsky et al. (2015) highlights that let-7 miRNAs target the transcription factor PLZF to modulate the differentiation of natural killer T (NKT) cells, indicating a critical role of miRNAs in regulating transcription factors during immune cell development (Pobezinsky, L. A., et al. (2015). Let-7 miRNAs target the lineage-specific transcription factor PLZF to regulate terminal NKT cell differentiation and effector function. Nature Immunology). Additionally, Foxp3 is identified as a critical transcription factor in the differentiation and function of regulatory T cells (Treg), with T-cell receptor signaling being central to this process; however, how miRNAs interact with Foxp3 in this context remains less understood (Ono, M. (2020). Control of regulatory T‐cell differentiation and function by T‐cell receptor signalling and Foxp3 transcription factor complexes. Immunology). These insights indicate potential avenues for further exploration, particularly regarding the interplay of miRNAs and transcription factors in immune cell differentiation, which could lead to novel therapeutic approaches in immunomodulation.

--- Paper 1: The transcription factors T-bet and GATA-3 control alternative pathways of T-cell differentiation through a shared set of target genes ---
Upon detection of antigen, CD4+ T helper (Th) cells can differentiate into a number of effector types that tailor the immune response to different pathogens. Alternative Th1 and Th2 cell fates are specified by the transcription factors T-bet and GATA-3, respectively. Only a handful of target genes are known for these two factors and because of this, the mechanism through which T-bet and GATA-3 induce differentiation toward alternative cell fates is not fully understood. Here, we provide a genomic map of T-bet and GATA-3 binding in primary human T cells and identify their target genes, most of which are previously unknown. In Th1 cells, T-bet associates with genes of diverse function, including those with roles in transcriptional regulation, chemotaxis and adhesion. GATA-3 occupies genes in both Th1 and Th2 cells and, unexpectedly, shares a large proportion of targets with T-bet. Re-complementation of T-bet alters the expression of these genes in a manner that mirrors their differential expression between Th1 and Th2 lineages. These data show that the choice between Th1 and Th2 lineage commitment is the result of the opposing action of T-bet and GATA-3 at a shared set of target genes and may provide a general paradigm for the interaction of lineage-specifying transcription factors.

--- Paper 2: Cytomegalovirus Latency and Reactivation: An Intricate Interplay With the Host Immune Response ---
CMV is an ancient herpesvirus that has co-evolved with its host over millions of years. The 236 kbp genome encodes at least 165 genes, four non-coding RNAs and 14 miRNAs. Of the protein-coding genes, 43–44 are core replication genes common to all herpesviruses, while ~30 are unique to betaherpesviruses. Many CMV genes are involved in evading detection by the host immune response, and others have roles in cell tropism. CMV replicates systemically, and thus, has adapted to various biological niches within the host. Different biological niches may place competing demands on the virus, such that genes that are favorable in some contexts are unfavorable in others. The outcome of infection is dependent on the cell type. In fibroblasts, the virus replicates lytically to produce infectious virus. In other cell types, such as myeloid progenitor cells, there is an initial burst of lytic gene expression, which is subsequently silenced through epigenetic repression, leading to establishment of latency. Latently infected monocytes disseminate the virus to various organs. Latency is established through cell type specific mechanisms of transcriptional silencing. In contrast, reactivation is triggered through pathways activated by inflammation, infection, and injury that are common to many cell types, as well as differentiation of myeloid cells to dendritic cells. Thus, CMV has evolved a complex relationship with the host immune response, in which it exploits cell type specific mechanisms of gene regulation to establish latency and to disseminate infection systemically, and also uses the inflammatory response to infection as an early warning system which allows the virus to escape from situations in which its survival is threatened, either by cellular damage or infection of the host with another pathogen. Spontaneous reactivation induced by cellular aging/damage may explain why extensive expression of lytic genes has been observed in recent studies using highly sensitive transcriptome analyses of cells from latently infected individuals. Recent studies with animal models highlight the potential for harnessing the host immune response to blunt cellular injury induced by organ transplantation, and thus, prevent reactivation of CMV and its sequelae.

--- Paper 3: Roles for miRNAs in osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells ---
Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), which were first discovered in bone marrow, are capable of differentiating into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, fat cells, and even myoblasts, and are considered multipotent cells. As a result of their potential for multipotential differentiation, self-renewal, immune regulation, and other effects, BMSCs have become an important source of seed cells for gene therapy, tissue engineering, cell replacement therapy, and regenerative medicine. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a highly conserved type of endogenous non-protein-encoding RNA of about 19–25 nucleotides in length, whose transcription process is independent of other genes. Generally, miRNA plays roles in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and development by binding to the 3′ untranslated region of target mRNAs, whereby they can degrade or induce translational silencing. Although miRNAs play a regulatory role in various metabolic processes, they are not translated into proteins. Several studies have shown that miRNAs play an important role in the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Herein, we describe in-depth studies of roles for miRNAs during the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, as they provide new theoretical and experimental rationales for bone tissue engineering and clinical treatment.

--- Paper 4: lncRNAs regulate the innate immune response to viral infection ---
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are extensively expressed in mammalian cells and play a crucial role as RNA regulators in various cellular processes. Increasing data reveal that they function in innate antiviral immunity through complex mechanisms. Thousands of lncRNAs are regulated by RNA virus or DNA virus infection. The significant differential expression of lncRNAs is induced by virus or host antiviral signaling mediated by interferons (IFNs) and tumor necrosis factor‐α. In turn, these lncRNAs modulate the host immune response including the pathogen recognition receptor (PRR)‐related signaling, the translocation and activation of transcription factors, the production of IFNs and cytokines, the IFN‐activated JAK‐STAT signaling and the transcription of antiviral IFN‐stimulated genes (ISGs). Using gain‐ or loss‐of‐function analysis, the effect of lncRNAs on viral replication has been investigated to elucidate the essential role of lncRNA in the host–virus interaction. lncRNAs have shown specifically elevated or decreased levels in patients with viral diseases, suggesting the possibility of clinical application as biomarkers. Here we review the current advances of viral infection‐associated host lncRNAs, their functional significance in different aspects of antiviral immune response, the specific mechanisms and unsolved issues. We also summarize the regulation of lncRNAs by viruses, PRR agonists and cytokines. In addition, virus‐encoded lncRNAs and their functional involvement in host–virus interaction are addressed.

--- Paper 5: Mucosal Immunity and the FOXO1 Transcription Factors ---
FOXO1 transcription factors affect a number of cell types that are important in the host response. Cell types whose functions are modulated by FOXO1 include keratinocytes in the skin and mucosal dermis, neutrophils and macrophages, dendritic cells, Tregs and B-cells. FOXO1 is activated by bacterial or cytokine stimulation. Its translocation to the nucleus and binding to promoter regions of genes that have FOXO response elements is stimulated by the MAP kinase pathway and inhibited by the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway. Downstream gene targets of FOXO1 include pro-inflammatory signaling molecules (TLR2, TLR4, IL-1β, and TNF-α), wound healing factors (TGF-β, VEGF, and CTGF) adhesion molecules (integrins-β1, -β3, -β6, αvβ3, CD11b, CD18, and ICAM-1), chemokine receptors (CCR7 and CXCR2), B cell regulators (APRIL and BLYS), T-regulatory modulators (Foxp3 and CTLA-4), antioxidants (GPX-2 and cytoglobin), and DNA repair enzymes (GADD45α). Each of the above cell types are found in oral mucosa and modulated by bacteria or an inflammatory microenvironment. FOXO1 contributes to the regulation of these cells, which collectively maintain and repair the epithelial barrier, formation and activation of Tregs that are needed to resolve inflammation, mobilization, infiltration, and activation of anti-bacterial defenses in neutrophils, and the homing of dendritic cells to lymph nodes to induce T-cell and B-cell responses. The goal of the manuscript is to review how the transcription factor, FOXO1, contributes to the activation and regulation of key leukocytes needed to maintain homeostasis and respond to bacterial challenge in oral mucosal tissues. Examples are given with an emphasis on lineage specific deletion of Foxo1 to explore the impact of FOXO1 on cell behavior, inflammation and susceptibility to infection.

The regulation of immune responses by microRNAs (miRNAs) and their interaction with transcription factors is evident across multiple studies, though specific pathways and targets remain underexplored. Paper 1 highlights the roles of transcription factors T-bet and GATA-3 in T-cell differentiation, identifying shared target genes that could align with miRNA regulation, suggesting an intricate network where miRNAs might modulate the action of these transcription factors in driving immune responses (Richard G. Jenner et al., 2009, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences). Moreover, Paper 3 notes that miRNAs significantly influence the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), hinting at potential parallels in how miRNAs might regulate or interact with transcription factors like FOXO1 that are crucial in immune cell modulation (Jicheng Wang et al., 2019, Stem Cell Research & Therapeutics). Although Paper 5 elaborates on the downstream targets of FOXO1 that are relevant for the immune response, the specific link between these targets and miRNA interactions remains a knowledge gap, opening avenues for future research (D. Graves & T. Milovanova, 2019, Frontiers in Immunology). These insights suggest that exploring the interplay between specific miRNAs and key transcription factors in immune differentiation could yield novel hypotheses and therapeutic strategies.

--- Paper 1: Targeting microRNAs as key modulators of tumor immune response ---
The role of immune response is emerging as a key factor in the complex multistep process of cancer. Tumor microenvironment contains different types of immune cells, which contribute to regulate the fine balance between anti and protumor signals. In this context, mechanisms of crosstalk between cancer and immune cells remain to be extensively elucidated. Interestingly, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to function as crucial regulators of immune response in both physiological and pathological conditions. Specifically, different miRNAs have been reported to have a role in controlling the development and the functions of tumor-associated immune cells. This review aims to describe the most important miRNAs acting as critical modulators of immune response in the context of different solid tumors. In particular, we discuss recent studies that have demonstrated the existence of miRNA-mediated mechanisms regulating the recruitment and the activation status of specific tumor-associated immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, various miRNAs have been found to target key cancer-related immune pathways, which concur to mediate the secretion of immunosuppressive or immunostimulating factors by cancer or immune cells. Modalities of miRNA exchange and miRNA-based delivery strategies are also discussed. Based on these findings, the modulation of individual or multiple miRNAs has the potential to enhance or inhibit specific immune subpopulations supporting antitumor immune responses, thus contributing to negatively affect tumorigenesis. New miRNA-based strategies can be developed for more effective immunotherapeutic interventions in cancer.

--- Paper 2: MicroRNAs play a central role in molecular dysfunctions linking inflammation with cancer ---
It is now largely admitted that a pro‐inflammatory environment may curtail anti‐tumor immunity and favor cancer initiation and progression. The discovery that small non‐coding regulatory RNAs, namely microRNAs (miRNAs), regulate all aspects of cell proliferation, differentiation, and function has shed a new light on regulatory mechanisms linking inflammation and cancer. Thus, miRNAs such as miR‐21, miR‐125b, miR‐155, miR‐196, and miR‐210 that are critical for the immune response or hypoxia are often overexpressed in cancers and leukemias. Given the high number of their target transcripts, their deregulation may have a number of deleterious consequences, depending on the cellular context. In this review, we focus on how the factors encoded by transcripts targeted by these five miRNAs, be they transcription factors, tumor‐suppressors, or regulators of different signaling pathways, can deregulate the immune response and favor pro‐tumor immunity. Furthermore, we expose how the misdirected action of the main regulators of these miRNAs, such as nuclear factor κB (NF‐κB), activator protein‐1 (AP‐1), and signal transduction and activators of transcription (STAT) transcription factors, or AKT and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling pathways, can contribute to decrease anti‐tumor immunity and enhance cell proliferation and oncogenesis. We conclude by briefly discussing about how these discoveries may possibly lead to the development of new miRNA‐based cancer therapies.

--- Paper 3: TFEB and TFE3 cooperate in the regulation of the innate immune response in activated macrophages ---
ABSTRACT The activation of transcription factors is critical to ensure an effective defense against pathogens. In this study we identify a critical and complementary role of the transcription factors TFEB and TFE3 in innate immune response. By using a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome-editing technology, and in vivo models, we determined that TFEB and TFE3 collaborate with each other in activated macrophages and microglia to promote efficient autophagy induction, increased lysosomal biogenesis, and transcriptional upregulation of numerous proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, secretion of key mediators of the inflammatory response (CSF2, IL1B, IL2, and IL27), macrophage differentiation (CSF1), and macrophage infiltration and migration to sites of inflammation (CCL2) was significantly reduced in TFEB and TFE3 deficient cells. These new insights provide us with a deeper understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the innate immune response.

--- Paper 4: CD4+T Cells: Differentiation and Functions ---
CD4+T cells are crucial in achieving a regulated effective immune response to pathogens. Naive CD4+T cells are activated after interaction with antigen-MHC complex and differentiate into specific subtypes depending mainly on the cytokine milieu of the microenvironment. Besides the classical T-helper 1 and T-helper 2, other subsets have been identified, including T-helper 17, regulatory T cell, follicular helper T cell, and T-helper 9, each with a characteristic cytokine profile. For a particular phenotype to be differentiated, a set of cytokine signaling pathways coupled with activation of lineage-specific transcription factors and epigenetic modifications at appropriate genes are required. The effector functions of these cells are mediated by the cytokines secreted by the differentiated cells. This paper will focus on the cytokine-signaling and the network of transcription factors responsible for the differentiation of naive CD4+T cells.

--- Paper 5: Transcription factors: Bridge between cell signaling and gene regulation ---
Transcription factors (TFs) are key regulators of intrinsic cellular processes, such as differentiation and development, and of the cellular response to external perturbation through signaling pathways. In this review we focus on the role of TFs as a link between signaling pathways and gene regulation. Cell signaling tends to result in the modulation of a set of TFs that then lead to changes in the cell's transcriptional program. We highlight the molecular layers at which TF activity can be measured and the associated technical and conceptual challenges. These layers include post‐translational modifications (PTMs) of the TF, regulation of TF binding to DNA through chromatin accessibility and epigenetics, and expression of target genes. We highlight that a large number of TFs are understudied in both signaling and gene regulation studies, and that our knowledge about known TF targets has a strong literature bias. We argue that TFs serve as a perfect bridge between the fields of gene regulation and signaling, and that separating these fields hinders our understanding of cell functions. Multi‐omics approaches that measure multiple dimensions of TF activity are ideally suited to study the interplay of cell signaling and gene regulation using TFs as the anchor to link the two fields.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to actively regulate immune responses and are implicated in the modulation of immune cell differentiation through their interaction with various transcription factors. For instance, specific miRNAs, such as miR-21 and miR-155, are associated with the regulation of immune responses and inflammation in cancer, impacting the action of transcription factors like NF-κB and AP-1, which in turn can promote a pro-tumor environment (MicroRNAs play a central role in molecular dysfunctions linking inflammation with cancer) (Esmerina Tili, J.

Additionally, the findings regarding TFEB and TFE3 indicate their essential roles in macrophage activation, where transcription factor activity is critical for the immune response (TFEB and TFE3 cooperate in the regulation of the innate immune response in activated macrophages) (Nunzia Pastore et al., Autophagy). There is also a noted correlation between cytokine signaling and the differentiation of CD4+ T cells, where lineage-specific transcription factors guided by microenvironmental cues dictate outcomes (CD4+T Cells: Differentiation and Functions) (Rishi Vishal Luckheeram et al., Clinical and Developmental Immunology). Despite these insights, the specific functions of numerous miRNAs and their detailed interactions with distinct transcription factors relevant for potent immune differentiation remain inadequately explored, suggesting a significant gap for future hypotheses focused on the pathways linking miRNA action with transcription factor regulation in immune contexts.

IL-17 cytokine family members have diverse biological functions, promoting protective immunity against many pathogens but also driving inflammatory pathology during infection and autoimmunity. IL-17A and IL-17F are produced by CD4^+ and CD8^+ T cells, γδ T cells, and various innate immune cell populations in response to IL-1β and IL-23, and they mediate protective immunity against fungi and bacteria by promoting neutrophil recruitment, antimicrobial peptide production and enhanced barrier function. IL-17-driven inflammation is normally controlled by regulatory T cells and the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10, TGFβ and IL-35. However, if dysregulated, IL-17 responses can promote immunopathology in the context of infection or autoimmunity. Moreover, IL-17 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many other disorders with an inflammatory basis, including cardiovascular and neurological diseases. Consequently, the IL-17 pathway is now a key drug target in many autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders; therapeutic monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-17A, both IL-17A and IL-17F, the IL-17 receptor, or IL-23 are highly effective in some of these diseases. However, new approaches are needed to specifically regulate IL-17-mediated immunopathology in chronic inflammation and autoimmunity without compromising protective immunity to infection.

--- Paper 2: Effects of Anti-IL-17 on Inflammation, Remodeling, and Oxidative Stress in an Experimental Model of Asthma Exacerbated by LPS ---
Inflammation plays a central role in the development of asthma, which is considered an allergic disease with a classic Th2 inflammatory profile. However, cytokine IL-17 has been examined to better understand the pathophysiology of this disease. Severe asthmatic patients experience frequent exacerbations, leading to infection, and subsequently show altered levels of inflammation that are unlikely to be due to the Th2 immune response alone. This study estimates the effects of anti-IL-17 therapy in the pulmonary parenchyma in a murine asthma model exacerbated by LPS. BALB/c mice were sensitized with intraperitoneal ovalbumin and repeatedly exposed to inhalation with ovalbumin, followed by treatment with or without anti-IL-17. Twenty-four hours prior to the end of the 29-day experimental protocol, the two groups received LPS (0.1 mg/ml intratracheal OVA-LPS and OVA-LPS IL-17). We subsequently evaluated bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, performed a lung tissue morphometric analysis, and measured IL-6 gene expression. OVA-LPS-treated animals treated with anti-IL-17 showed decreased pulmonary inflammation, edema, oxidative stress, and extracellular matrix remodeling compared to the non-treated OVA and OVA-LPS groups (p < 0.05). The anti-IL-17 treatment also decreased the numbers of dendritic cells, FOXP3, NF-κB, and Rho kinase 1- and 2-positive cells compared to the non-treated OVA and OVA-LPS groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, these data suggest that inhibition of IL-17 is a promising therapeutic avenue, even in exacerbated asthmatic patients, and significantly contributes to the control of Th1/Th2/Th17 inflammation, chemokine expression, extracellular matrix remodeling, and oxidative stress in a murine experimental asthma model exacerbated by LPS.

--- Paper 3: Lessons Learned From Trials Targeting Cytokine Pathways in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. ---
Insights into the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) have provided important information for the development of therapeutics. Levels of interleukin 23 (IL23) and T-helper (Th) 17 cell pathway molecules are increased in inflamed intestinal tissues of patients with IBD. Loss-of-function variants of the IL23-receptor gene (IL23R) protect against IBD, and, in animals, blocking IL23 reduces the severity of colitis. These findings indicated that the IL23 and Th17 cell pathways might be promising targets for the treatment of IBD. Clinical trials have investigated the effects of agents designed to target distinct levels of the IL23 and Th17 cell pathways, and the results are providing insights into IBD pathogenesis and additional strategies for modulating these pathways. Strategies to reduce levels of proinflammatory cytokines more broadly and increase anti-inflammatory mechanisms also are emerging for the treatment of IBD. The results from trials targeting these immune system pathways have provided important lessons for future trials. Findings indicate the importance of improving approaches to integrate patient features and biomarkers of response with selection of therapeutics.

--- Paper 4: IL-17 and immunologically induced senescence regulate response to injury in osteoarthritis. ---
Senescent cells (SnCs) are implicated in the pathogenesis of age-related diseases including osteoarthritis (OA), in part via expression of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that includes immunologically relevant factors and cytokines. In a model of posttraumatic OA (PTOA), anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) induced a type 17 immune response in the articular compartment and draining inguinal lymph nodes (LNs) that paralleled expression of the senescence marker p16INK4a (Cdkn2a) and p21 (Cdkn1a). Innate lymphoid cells, γδ+ T cells, and CD4+ T cells contributed to IL-17 expression. Intra-articular injection of IL-17-neutralizing antibody reduced joint degeneration and decreased expression of the senescence marker Cdkn1a. Local and systemic senolysis was required to attenuate tissue damage in aged animals and was associated with decreased IL-17 and increased IL-4 expression in the articular joint and draining LNs. In vitro, we found that Th17 cells induced senescence in fibroblasts and that SnCs skewed naive T cells toward Th17 or Th1, depending on the presence of TGF-β. The SASP profile of the inflammation-induced SnCs included altered Wnt signaling, tissue remodeling, and cell-cycle pathways not previously implicated in senescence. These findings provide molecular targets and mechanisms for senescence induction and therapeutic strategies to support tissue healing in an aged environment.

Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a multifaceted cytokine with diverse roles in both immune protection and also immunopathology. IL-17 has a well-recognized role in immune surveillance at mucosal and barrier surfaces, but also has been increasingly implicated as a driver of immunopathology in settings of autoimmunity and chronic inflammation. The current review introduces basic aspects of IL-17 biology and examines the protective and pathogenic roles of IL-17 with a focus on oral mucosal immunity and inflammation. Specific emphasis is given to the role of the IL-17 response as a catalyst in 'shaping the microbiome at the oral barrier'.

The interaction between microRNAs (miRNAs) and IL-17 pathways in immune response regulation, particularly in autoimmune disorders, is underscored by the critical role of IL-17 in both protective immunity and pathological conditions. IL-17 is produced by various T cells and has been implicated in autoimmunity, as it drives inflammatory responses that, when dysregulated, contribute to immunopathology (IL-17 and IL-17-producing cells in protection versus pathology, K. Mills, Nature Reviews Immunology, 2022). In the context of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), higher levels of IL-23 and Th17 pathway molecules indicate a link between dysregulated cytokine signaling and disease progression, suggesting that targeting these pathways could be beneficial for therapeutic interventions (Lessons Learned From Trials Targeting Cytokine Pathways in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, C. Abraham et al., Gastroenterology, 2017). Furthermore, research into Th17 cells indicates that they can induce cellular senescence, complicating the relationship between these immune responses and the development of autoimmunity (IL-17 and immunologically induced senescence regulate response to injury in osteoarthritis, H. J. Faust et al., Journal of Clinical Investigation, 2020). However, the specific role of miRNAs in modulating IL-17 signaling pathways remains unexplored in these studies, presenting a significant knowledge gap that could inspire new therapeutic hypotheses. Thus, investigating miRNA interactions with IL-17 pathways may unveil novel regulatory mechanisms important for managing autoimmune disorders.

--- Paper 1: Interleukin-23 (IL-23)-IL-17 Cytokine Axis in Murine Pneumocystis carinii Infection ---
ABSTRACT Host defense mechanisms against Pneumocystis carinii are not fully understood. Previous work in the murine model has shown that host defense against infection is critically dependent upon host CD4+ T cells. The recently described Th17 immune response is predominantly a function of effector CD4+ T cells stimulated by interleukin-23 (IL-23), but whether these cells are required for defense against P. carinii infection is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that P. carinii stimulates the early release of IL-23, leading to increases in IL-17 production and lung effector CD4+ T-cell population that mediate clearance of infection. In vitro, stimulation of alveolar macrophages with P. carinii induced IL-23, and IL-23p19 mRNA was expressed in lungs of mice infected with this pathogen. To address the role of IL-23 in resistance to P. carinii, IL-23p19−/− and wild-type control C57BL/6 mice were infected and their fungal burdens and cytokine/chemokine responses were compared. IL-23p19−/− mice displayed transient but impaired clearance of infection, which was most apparent 2 weeks after inoculation. In confirmatory studies, the administration of either anti-IL-23p19 or anti-IL-17 neutralizing antibody to wild-type mice infected with P. carinii also caused increases in fungal burdens. IL-17 and the lymphocyte chemokines IP-10, MIG, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES were decreased in the lungs of infected IL-23p19−/− mice in comparison to their levels in the lungs of wild-type mice. In IL-23p19−/− mice infected with P. carinii, there were fewer effector CD4+ T cells in the lung tissue. Collectively, these studies indicate that the IL-23-IL-17 axis participates in host defense against P. carinii.

--- Paper 2: Th17 Cells and the IL-23/IL-17 Axis in the Pathogenesis of Periodontitis and Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases ---
Innate immunity represents the semi-specific first line of defense and provides the initial host response to tissue injury, trauma, and pathogens. Innate immunity activates the adaptive immunity, and both act highly regulated together to establish and maintain tissue homeostasis. Any dysregulation of this interaction can result in chronic inflammation and autoimmunity and is thought to be a major underlying cause in the initiation and progression of highly prevalent immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases among others, and periodontitis. Th1 and Th2 cells of the adaptive immune system are the major players in the pathogenesis of IMIDs. In addition, Th17 cells, their key cytokine IL-17, and IL-23 seem to play pivotal roles. This review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge about the differentiation of Th17 cells and the role of the IL-17/IL-23 axis in the pathogenesis of IMIDs. Moreover, it aims to review the association of these IMIDs with periodontitis and briefly discusses the therapeutic potential of agents that modulate the IL-17/IL-23 axis.

--- Paper 3: IL-17-Mediated Regulation of Innate and Acquired Immune Response against Pulmonary Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin Infection1 ---
IL-17 is a cytokine that induces neutrophil-mediated inflammation, but its role in protective immunity against intracellular bacterial infection remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that IL-17 is an important cytokine not only in the early neutrophil-mediated inflammatory response, but also in T cell-mediated IFN-γ production and granuloma formation in response to pulmonary infection by Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG). IL-17 expression in the BCG-infected lung was detected from the first day after infection and the expression depended on IL-23. Our observations indicated that γδ T cells are a primary source of IL-17. Lung-infiltrating T cells of IL-17-deficient mice produced less IFN-γ in comparison to those from wild-type mice 4 wk after BCG infection. Impaired granuloma formation was also observed in the infected lungs of IL-17-deficient mice, which is consistent with the decreased delayed-type hypersensitivity response of the infected mice against mycobacterial Ag. These data suggest that IL-17 is an important cytokine in the induction of optimal Th1 response and protective immunity against mycobacterial infection.

--- Paper 4: Cytokines IL-17 and IL-22 in the host response to infection ---
Abstract Cytokines IL-17 and IL-22 play pivotal roles in host defense against microbes and in the development of chronic inflammatory diseases. These cytokines are produced by cells that are often located in epithelial barriers, including subsets of T cells and innate lymphoid cells. In general, IL-17 and IL-22 can be characterized as important cytokines in the rapid response to infectious agents, both by recruiting neutrophils and by inducing the production of antimicrobial peptides. Although each cytokine induces an innate immune response in epithelial cells, their functional spectra are generally distinct: IL-17 mainly induces an inflammatory tissue response and is involved in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, whereas IL-22 is largely protective and regenerative. In this review, we compare IL-17 and IL-22, describing overlaps and differences in their cellular sources as well as their regulation, signaling, biological functions and roles during disease, with a focus on the contribution of these cytokines to the gut mucosal barrier during bacterial infection.

--- Paper 5: Cytokine Targeting by miRNAs in Autoimmune Diseases ---
Persistent and excessive cytokine production is a hallmark of autoimmune diseases and may play a role in disease pathogenesis and amplification. Therefore, cytokine neutralization is a useful therapeutic strategy to treat immune-mediated conditions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression in diverse biological processes. Altered miRNA levels are observed in most autoimmune diseases and are recognized to influence autoimmunity through different mechanisms. Here, we review the impact of altered miRNA levels on the expression of cytokines that play a relevant pathogenic role in autoimmunity, namely primary pro-inflammatory cytokines, the IL-17/IL-23 axis, type I interferons and IL-10. Regulation can be either “direct” on the target cytokine, or “indirect,” meaning that one given miRNA post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of a protein that in turn influences the level of the cytokine. In addition, miRNAs associated with extracellular vesicles can regulate cytokine production in neighboring cells, either post-transcriptionally or via the stimulation of innate immune RNA-sensors, such as Toll-like receptors. Because of their tremendous potential as physiological and pathological regulators, miRNAs are in the limelight as promising future biopharmaceuticals. Thus, these studies may lead in the near future to the design and testing of therapeutic miRNAs as next generation drugs to target pathogenic cytokines in autoimmunity.

The interplay between microRNAs (miRNAs) and cytokine signaling, particularly regarding Interleukin-17 (IL-17) pathways, is crucial in the regulation of immune responses and the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders. Evidence highlights that altered levels of miRNAs can significantly influence the IL-17/IL-23 cytokine axis, which is implicated in various immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) (Cytokine Targeting by miRNAs in Autoimmune Diseases, V. Salvi et al., Frontiers in Immunology, 2019). This review indicates that miRNAs may exert either direct or indirect regulatory effects on cytokine expression, reinforcing the idea that therapeutic targeting of specific miRNAs could modify IL-17 signaling in autoimmune contexts (Cytokine Targeting by miRNAs in Autoimmune Diseases). Additionally, the role of the IL-23-IL-17 axis is emphasized in protective immunity against infections as well as dysfunctions in autoimmunity, revealing the critical balance required for effective immune response versus excessive inflammation (Interleukin-23 (IL-23)-IL-17 Cytokine Axis in Murine Pneumocystis carinii Infection, X.

Thus, the modulation of miRNAs provides a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention in conditions where IL-17-mediated inflammation is dysregulated.

--- Paper 1: IL‐17 in inflammatory skin diseases psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa ---
The skin is one of the most important organs in the body, providing integrity and acting as a barrier to exclude microbes, allergens and chemicals. However, chronic skin inflammation can result when barrier function is defective and immune responses are dysregulated or misdirected against harmless or self‐antigens. During the last 15 years interleukin (IL)‐17 cytokines have emerged as key players in multiple inflammatory disorders, and they appear to be especially prominent in skin inflammation. IL‐17 cytokines produced by T cells and other cell types potently activate keratinocytes to promote inflammation in a feed‐forward loop. Given this key pathogenic role of the IL‐17 pathway in autoimmune and inflammatory disease, it has been the focus of intense efforts to target therapeutically. The inflammatory effects of IL‐17 can be targeted directly by blocking the cytokine or its receptor, or indirectly by blocking cytokines upstream of IL‐17‐producing cells. Psoriasis has been the major success story for anti‐IL‐17 drugs, where they have proven more effective than in other indications. Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is another inflammatory skin disease which, despite carrying a higher burden than psoriasis, is poorly recognized and under‐diagnosed, and current treatment options are inadequate. Recently, a key role for the IL‐17 pathway in the pathogenesis of HS has emerged, prompting clinical trials with a variety of IL‐17 inhibitors. In this review, we discuss the roles of IL‐17A, IL‐17F and IL‐17C in psoriasis and HS and the strategies taken to target the IL‐17 pathway therapeutically.

--- Paper 2: The IL-17 family in diseases: from bench to bedside ---
The interleukin-17 (IL-17) family comprises six members (IL-17A–17F), and recently, all of its related receptors have been discovered. IL-17 was first discovered approximately 30 years ago. Members of this family have various biological functions, including driving an inflammatory cascade during infections and autoimmune diseases, as well as boosting protective immunity against various pathogens. IL-17 is a highly versatile proinflammatory cytokine necessary for vital processes including host immune defenses, tissue repair, inflammatory disease pathogenesis, and cancer progression. However, how IL-17 performs these functions remains controversial. The multifunctional properties of IL-17 have attracted research interest, and emerging data have gradually improved our understanding of the IL-17 signaling pathway. However, a comprehensive review is required to understand its role in both host defense functions and pathogenesis in the body. This review can aid researchers in better understanding the mechanisms underlying IL-17’s roles in vivo and provide a theoretical basis for future studies aiming to regulate IL-17 expression and function. This review discusses recent progress in understanding the IL-17 signaling pathway and its physiological roles. In addition, we present the mechanism underlying IL-17’s role in various pathologies, particularly, in IL-17-induced systemic lupus erythematosus and IL-17-related tumor cell transformation and metastasis. In addition, we have briefly discussed promising developments in the diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune diseases and tumors.

--- Paper 3: Functional relevance of T helper 17 (Th17) cells and the IL‐17 cytokine family in inflammatory bowel disease ---
&NA; The recent discovery and characterization of T helper 17 cells (Th17) and their signature cytokines (IL‐17) represents a hallmark in T‐cell immunobiology by providing a new distinctive pathway for the communication between adaptive and innate immunity. From the six members of the IL‐17 cytokine family presently known, at least two have evident proinflammatory qualities and are involved in several chronic inflammatory disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IL‐17A and IL‐17F are abundantly found in inflamed IBD mucosa, suggesting their pivotal role in IBD. However, the precise implication of IL‐17 cytokine family members in IBD pathogenesis and the mechanisms regulating their secretion are incompletely understood. Importantly, recent findings suggest that beyond IL‐17 production‐Th17 cells may secret a plethora of other effector cytokines such as IL‐21, IL‐22, and IL‐9‐ which is in part induced by its own IL‐9 production. However, the use of anti‐IL‐17 therapeutic strategies in experimental models of chronic inflammation results in disease‐ameliorating effects suggesting their potential use in IBD patients. In this review article we discuss the latest findings on the role of Th17 cells and IL‐17 family members in IBD immunopathology, as well as research perspectives. (Inflamm Bowel Dis 2011;)

--- Paper 4: Role of the IL-23/IL-17 Pathway in Rheumatic Diseases: An Overview ---
Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine composed of two subunits, IL-23A (p19) and IL-12/23B (p40), the latter shared with Interleukin-12 (IL-12). IL-23 is mainly produced by macrophages and dendritic cells, in response to exogenous or endogenous signals, and drives the differentiation and activation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells with subsequent production of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-6, IL-22, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Although IL-23 plays a pivotal role in the protective immune response to bacterial and fungal infections, its dysregulation has been shown to exacerbate chronic immune-mediated inflammation. Well-established experimental data support the concept that IL-23/IL-17 axis activation contributes to the development of several inflammatory diseases, such as PsA, Psoriasis, Psoriatic Arthritis; AS, Ankylosing Spondylitis; IBD, Inflammatory Bowel Disease; RA, Rheumatoid Arthritis; SS, Sjogren Syndrome; MS, Multiple Sclerosis. As a result, emerging clinical studies have focused on the blockade of this pathogenic axis as a promising therapeutic target in several autoimmune disorders; nevertheless, a greater understanding of its contribution still requires further investigation. This review aims to elucidate the most recent studies and literature data on the pathogenetic role of IL-23 and Th17 cells in inflammatory rheumatic diseases.

--- Paper 5: Analysis of IL-17+ cells in facet joints of patients with spondyloarthritis suggests that the innate immune pathway might be of greater relevance than the Th17-mediated adaptive immune response ---
IntroductionIn this study, we analysed the number of IL-17+ cells in facet joints, in the peripheral blood (PB) and synovial fluid (SF) of spondyloarthritis (SpA) patients and compared these results with those of patients with other rheumatic diseases and controls.MethodsImmunohistochemical analysis of IL-17+ cells was performed in facet joints of 33 ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients and compared with data from 20 osteoarthritis (OA) patients. The frequency of IL-17+CD4+ T cells in PB and SF of SpA patients (PB n = 30, SF n = 11), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients (PB n = 14, SF n = 7), OA patients (PB n = 10) and healthy controls (PB n = 12) was analysed after stimulation with Staphylococcus aureus Enterotoxin B and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin and quantified by flow cytometry.ResultsIn AS facet joints, the frequency of IL-17-secreting cells was significantly higher than in samples obtained from OA patients (P < 0.001), with a slight predominance of IL-17+ cells among the mononuclear cells (61.5% ± 14.9%) compared to cells with polysegmental nuclei. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the majority of IL-17+ cells were myeloperoxidase-positive (35.84 ± 13.06/high-power field (HPF) and CD15+ neutrophils (24.25 ± 10.36/HPF), while CD3+ T cells (0.51 ± 0.49/HPF) and AA-1+ mast cells (2.28 ± 1.96/HPF) were less often IL-17-positive. The frequency of IL-17+CD4+ T cells in the PB and SF of SpA patients did not differ significantly compared to RA patients, OA patients or healthy controls.ConclusionsOur data suggest an important role for IL-17 in the inflammatory processes in AS. However, the innate immune pathway might be of greater relevance than the Th17-mediated adaptive immune response.

The abstracts provided do not explicitly address microRNAs (miRNAs) in relation to the modulation of IL-17 pathways within autoimmune disorders. However, some insights may suggest avenues for future research. For instance, the role of IL-17 has been highlighted as pivotal in various inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa (Fletcher et al., 2020, Clinical and Experimental Immunology). In particular, the IL-23/IL-17 axis is implicated in exacerbating chronic immune responses, emphasizing the need for therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway (Schinocca et al., 2021, Frontiers in Immunology). Lastly, emerging data point to the complex interplay of Th17 cells and their cytokine environment, which could be influenced by miRNAs, although specific mechanisms remain underexplored (Hundorfean et al., 2012, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases). Research focusing on how miRNAs regulate IL-17 signaling may reveal novel pathways for intervention in autoimmune disorders, leveraging the established importance of IL-17 in these diseases.

--- Paper 1: IL‐17 in inflammatory skin diseases psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa ---
The skin is one of the most important organs in the body, providing integrity and acting as a barrier to exclude microbes, allergens and chemicals. However, chronic skin inflammation can result when barrier function is defective and immune responses are dysregulated or misdirected against harmless or self‐antigens. During the last 15 years interleukin (IL)‐17 cytokines have emerged as key players in multiple inflammatory disorders, and they appear to be especially prominent in skin inflammation. IL‐17 cytokines produced by T cells and other cell types potently activate keratinocytes to promote inflammation in a feed‐forward loop. Given this key pathogenic role of the IL‐17 pathway in autoimmune and inflammatory disease, it has been the focus of intense efforts to target therapeutically. The inflammatory effects of IL‐17 can be targeted directly by blocking the cytokine or its receptor, or indirectly by blocking cytokines upstream of IL‐17‐producing cells. Psoriasis has been the major success story for anti‐IL‐17 drugs, where they have proven more effective than in other indications. Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is another inflammatory skin disease which, despite carrying a higher burden than psoriasis, is poorly recognized and under‐diagnosed, and current treatment options are inadequate. Recently, a key role for the IL‐17 pathway in the pathogenesis of HS has emerged, prompting clinical trials with a variety of IL‐17 inhibitors. In this review, we discuss the roles of IL‐17A, IL‐17F and IL‐17C in psoriasis and HS and the strategies taken to target the IL‐17 pathway therapeutically.

--- Paper 2: The TNF/IL‐23/IL‐17 axis—Head‐to‐head trials comparing different biologics in psoriasis treatment ---
Psoriasis is a T cell–mediated disease with autoimmune characteristics modulated by genetic susceptibility along with environmental triggers. Inflammatory pathways marked with excessive production of cytokines IL‐12 and IL‐23, drive differentiation of pathogenic T cell responses resulting in TNF and IL‐17 production. These cytokines are an integral part of the TNF/IL‐23/IL‐17 axis, which is responsible for maintaining inflammation in psoriatic skin. Our improved understanding of the immunopathogenesis led to the development of biological drugs in the treatment of moderate‐to‐severe disease. Biologics have revolutionized the management of psoriasis, highlighting the central role of TNF/IL‐23/IL‐17 axis in the physiopathology of the disease. Still, psoriasis usually requires long‐term treatment, aiming to fully remove psoriatic lesions without experiencing adverse events. In this review, we discuss the recent findings of all 27 available head‐to‐head trials investigating the efficacy and safety of systemic and biologic therapies in moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis vulgaris, as it is thought to provide more useful knowledge than placebo intervention alone. According to our evaluation, inhibitors that specifically target IL‐23 or IL‐17 are clinically more beneficial than inhibitors of IL‐12/IL‐23 and TNF. More informative results might be obtained by comparing these more efficient biological agents to each other. In addition, newer therapies for psoriasis using small‐molecule drugs may represent important advances compared to well‐established biologics as these are less expensive and orally administered.

--- Paper 3: The Role of the IL-23/IL-17 Pathway in the Pathogenesis of Spondyloarthritis ---
Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a subset of seronegative rheumatic-related autoimmune diseases that consist of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic spondylitis (PsA), reactive spondylitis (re-SpA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated spondylitis, and unclassifiable spondylitis. These subsets share clinical phenotypes such as joint inflammation and extra-articular manifestations (uveitis, IBD, and psoriasis [Ps]). Inflammation at the enthesis, where ligaments and tendons attach to bones, characterizes and distinguishes SpA from other types of arthritis. Over the past several years, genetic, experimental, and clinical studies have accumulated evidence showing that the IL-23/IL-17 axis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of SpA. These discoveries include genetic association and the identification of IL-23- and IL-17-producing cells in the tissue of mouse models and human patients. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the pathomechanism by focusing on the IL-23/IL-17 pathway and examine the recent clinical studies of biological agents targeting IL-23 and IL-17 in the treatment of SpA.

--- Paper 4: ABD-Derived Protein Blockers of Human IL-17 Receptor A as Non-IgG Alternatives for Modulation of IL-17-Dependent Pro-Inflammatory Axis ---
Interleukin 17 (IL-17) and its cognate receptor A (IL-17RA) play a crucial role in Th17 cells-mediated pro-inflammatory pathway and pathogenesis of several autoimmune disorders including psoriasis. IL-17 is mainly produced by activated Th-17 helper cells upon stimulation by IL-23 and, via binding to its receptors, mediates IL-17-driven cell signaling in keratinocytes. Hyper-proliferation of keratinocytes belongs to major clinical manifestations in psoriasis. To modulate IL-17-mediated inflammatory cascade, we generated a unique collection of IL-17RA-targeting protein binders that prevent from binding of human IL-17A cytokine to its cell-surface receptor. To this goal, we used a highly complex combinatorial library derived from scaffold of albumin-binding domain (ABD) of streptococcal protein G, and ribosome display selection, to yield a collection of ABD-derived high-affinity ligands of human IL-17RA, called ARS binders. From 67 analyzed ABD variants, 7 different sequence families were identified. Representatives of these groups competed with human IL-17A for binding to recombinant IL-17RA receptor as well as to IL-17RA-Immunoglobulin G chimera, as tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Five ARS variants bound to IL-17RA-expressing THP-1 cells and blocked binding of human IL-17 cytokine to the cell surface, as tested by flow cytometry. Three variants exhibited high-affinity binding with a nanomolar Kd value to human keratinocyte HaCaT cells, as measured using Ligand Tracer Green Line. Upon IL-17-stimulated activation, ARS variants inhibited secretion of Gro-α (CXCL1) by normal human skin fibroblasts in vitro. Thus, we identified a novel class of inhibitory ligands that might serve as immunosuppressive IL-17RA-targeted non-IgG protein antagonists.

--- Paper 5: The Role of IL-17 and Th17 Lymphocytes in Autoimmune Diseases ---
The end of twentieth century has introduced some changes into T helper (Th) cells division. The identification of the new subpopulation of T helper cells producing IL-17 modified model of Th1–Th2 paradigm and it was named Th17. High abilities to stimulate acute and chronic inflammation made these cells ideal candidate for crucial player in development of autoimmune disorders. Numerous publications based on animal and human models confirmed their pivotal role in pathogenesis of human systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases. These findings made Th17 cells and pathways regulating their development and function a good target for therapy. Therapies based on inhibition of Th17-dependent pathways are associated with clinical benefits, but on the other hand are frequently inducing adverse effects. In this review, we attempt to summarize researches focused on the importance of Th17 cells in development of human autoimmune diseases as well as effectiveness of targeting IL-17 and its pathways in pre-clinical and clinical studies.

The IL-17 pathway plays a significant role in several autoimmune disorders, particularly psoriasis and spondyloarthritis, whereby genetic variations in IL17A and IL17F genes may influence disease susceptibility and progression. The contribution of IL-17 cytokines to autoimmune pathogenesis is emphasized in various conditions, including psoriasis, where the TNF/IL-23/IL-17 axis is critical for maintaining inflammation (The TNF/IL‐23/IL‐17 axis—Head‐to‐head trials comparing different biologics in psoriasis treatment). Furthermore, studies indicate that targeting the IL-17 pathway through biologic therapies provides clinical benefits, although adverse effects are often reported (The Role of IL-17 and Th17 Lymphocytes in Autoimmune Diseases). The potential genetic influences on the IL-17 pathway, particularly regarding IL17A and IL17F variations, suggest opportunities for personalized medicine approaches in managing these conditions (The Role of the IL-23/IL-17 Pathway in the Pathogenesis of Spondyloarthritis). In addition, ongoing research highlights the importance of Th17 cells in stimulating inflammation in autoimmune diseases, pointing to a need for further investigation into how genetic factors might modify these pathways and responses to therapies targeting IL-17 (IL-17 in inflammatory skin diseases psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa). Overall, there is a consensus on the pathogenic role of IL-17, yet a gap exists in fully understanding the specific genetic influences of IL17A and IL17F on these pathways.

Papers Provided (Abstracts):
--- Paper 1: Differential Mucosal IL-17 Expression in Two Gliadin-Induced Disorders: Gluten Sensitivity and the Autoimmune Enteropathy Celiac Disease ---
Background: The immune-mediated enteropathy, celiac disease (CD), and gluten sensitivity (GS) are two distinct clinical conditions that are both triggered by the ingestion of wheat gliadin. CD, but not GS, is associated with and possibly mediated by an autoimmune process. Recent studies show that gliadin may induce the activation of IL-17-producing T cells and that IL-17 expression in the CD mucosa correlates with gluten intake. Methods: The small-intestinal mucosa of patients with CD and GS and dyspeptic controls was analyzed for expression of IL-17A mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR. The number of CD3+ and TCR-γδ lymphocytes and the proportion of CD3+ cells coexpressing the Th17 marker CCR6 were examined by in situ small-intestinal immunohistochemistry. Results: Mucosal expression of IL-17A was significantly increased in CD but not in GS patients, compared to controls. This difference was due to enhanced IL-17A levels in >50% of CD patients, with the remainder expressing levels similar to GS patients or controls, and was paralleled by a trend toward increased proportions of CD3+CCR6+ cells in intestinal mucosal specimens from these subjects. Conclusion: We conclude that GS, albeit gluten-induced, is different from CD not only with respect to the genetic makeup and clinical and functional parameters, but also with respect to the nature of the immune response. Our findings also suggest that two subgroups of CD, IL-17-dependent and IL-17-independent, may be identified based on differential mucosal expression of this cytokine.

--- Paper 2: Role of IL‐17 in atopy—A systematic review ---
Abstract Purpose of Review Atopy is defined as the genetic predisposition to react with type I allergic diseases such as food‐, skin‐, and respiratory allergies. Distinct molecular mechanisms have been described, including the known Th2 driven immune response. IL‐17A (IL‐17) is mainly produced by Th17 cells and belongs to the IL‐17 family of cytokines, IL‐17A to F. While IL‐17 plays a major role in inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, more data was published in recent years elucidating the role of IL‐17 in allergic diseases. The present study aimed to elaborate specifically the role of IL‐17 in atopy. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, regarding IL‐17 and atopy/allergic diseases. Results In total, 31 novel publications could be identified (food allergy n = 3, allergic asthma n = 7, allergic rhinitis [AR] n = 10, atopic dermatitis [AD] n = 11). In all allergic diseases, the IL‐17 pathway has been investigated. Serum IL‐17 was elevated in all allergic diseases. In AR, serum and nasal IL‐17 levels correlated with the severity of the disease. In food allergies, serum IL‐17E was also elevated in children. In AD, there is a trend for higher IL‐17 values in the serum and skin specimen, while it is more expressed in acute lesions. In allergic asthma, serum IL‐17 levels were increased. In two studies, higher serum IL‐17 levels were found in severe persistent asthmatic patients than in intermittent asthmatics or healthy controls. Only one therapeutic clinical study exists on allergic diseases (asthma patients) using a monoclonal antibody against the IL‐17 receptor A. No clinical efficacy was found in the total study population, except for a subgroup of patients with (post‐bronchodilator) high reversibility. Summary The role of IL 17 in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases is evident, but the involvement of the Th17 cytokine in the pathophysiological pathway is not conclusively defined. IL‐17 is most likely relevant and will be a clinical target in subgroups of patients. The current data indicates that IL‐17 is elevated more often in acute and severe forms of allergic diseases.

--- Paper 3: Functional Analysis of Immune Signature Genes in Th1* Memory Cells Links ISOC1 and Pyrimidine Metabolism to IFN-γ and IL-17 Production ---
Key Points Functional analysis of Th1* immune signature genes uncovers novel regulators of IFN-γ and IL-17. Loss of ISOC1 impairs CD4+ T cell pyrimidine metabolism, bioenergetics, and cytokine production. CCR6+CXCR3+CCR4−CD4+ memory T cells, termed Th1*, are important for long-term immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Th1* cells express a unique set of lineage-specific transcription factors characteristic of both Th1 and Th17 cells and display distinct gene expression profiles compared with other CD4+ T cell subsets. To examine molecules and signaling pathways important for the effector function of Th1* cells, we performed loss-of-function screening of genes selectively enriched in the Th1* subset. The genetic screen yielded candidates whose depletion significantly impaired TCR-induced IFN-γ production. These included genes previously linked to IFN-γ or M. tuberculosis susceptibility and novel candidates, such as ISOC1, encoding a metabolic enzyme of unknown function in mammalian cells. ISOC1-depleted T cells, which produced less IFN-γ and IL-17, displayed defects in oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis and impairment of pyrimidine metabolic pathway. Supplementation with extracellular pyrimidines rescued both bioenergetics and IFN-γ production in ISOC1-deficient T cells, indicating that pyrimidine metabolism is a key driver of effector functions in CD4+ T cells and Th1* cells. Results provide new insights into the immune-stimulatory function of ISOC1 as well as the particular metabolic requirements of human memory T cells, providing a novel resource for understanding long-term T cell–driven responses.

--- Paper 4: Role of the IL-23/IL-17 Pathway in Rheumatic Diseases: An Overview ---
Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine composed of two subunits, IL-23A (p19) and IL-12/23B (p40), the latter shared with Interleukin-12 (IL-12). IL-23 is mainly produced by macrophages and dendritic cells, in response to exogenous or endogenous signals, and drives the differentiation and activation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells with subsequent production of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-6, IL-22, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Although IL-23 plays a pivotal role in the protective immune response to bacterial and fungal infections, its dysregulation has been shown to exacerbate chronic immune-mediated inflammation. Well-established experimental data support the concept that IL-23/IL-17 axis activation contributes to the development of several inflammatory diseases, such as PsA, Psoriasis, Psoriatic Arthritis; AS, Ankylosing Spondylitis; IBD, Inflammatory Bowel Disease; RA, Rheumatoid Arthritis; SS, Sjogren Syndrome; MS, Multiple Sclerosis. As a result, emerging clinical studies have focused on the blockade of this pathogenic axis as a promising therapeutic target in several autoimmune disorders; nevertheless, a greater understanding of its contribution still requires further investigation. This review aims to elucidate the most recent studies and literature data on the pathogenetic role of IL-23 and Th17 cells in inflammatory rheumatic diseases.

--- Paper 5: Norcantharidin ameliorates the development of murine lupus via inhibiting the generation of IL-17 producing cells ---
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a devastating autoimmune disorder associated with severe organ damage. The abnormality of T cell apoptosis is considered as an important pathogenetic mechanism of SLE. Norcantharidin (NCTD), a derivative of Cantharidin, is an efficacious anti-cancer drug by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing cell apoptosis. Besides, NCTD has also been proved to protect the function of kidneys, while damaged renal function is the most important predictor of morbidity and mortality in SLE. All these suggest the potential effects of NCTD in SLE treatment. In this study we investigated whether NCTD exerted therapeutic effects in a mouse SLE model. Lupus prone female MRL/lpr mice were treated with NCTD (1, 2 mg·kg−1·d−1, ip) for 8 weeks. We showed that NCTD administration significantly decreased mortality rate, diminished the expression of anti-dsDNA IgG antibody, a diagnostic marker for SLE, as well as restored renal structure and function in MRL/lpr mice. Moreover, NCTD administration dose-dependently inhibited lymphoproliferation and T cell accumulation in the spleens of MRL/lpr mice. We further revealed that NCTD specifically inhibited DN T cell proliferation and Th17 cell differentiation both via blocking activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. On the other hand, NCTD did not affect T cell apoptosis in MRL/lpr mice. Taken together, our data suggest that NCTD may be as a promising therapeutic drug through targeting T cells for the treatment of SLE.

The role of Interleukin-17 (IL-17) in autoimmune disorders is underscored by its differential expression and regulation linked to specific genetic variations. For instance, in celiac disease (CD), elevated mucosal IL-17A levels were observed compared to gluten sensitivity, indicating a distinctive immune response potentially influenced by genetic factors (Differential Mucosal IL-17 Expression in Two Gliadin-Induced Disorders: Gluten Sensitivity and the Autoimmune Enteropathy Celiac Disease - A. Sapone et al., International Archives of Allergy and Immunology, 2009). Furthermore, IL-17's involvement in various autoimmune conditions suggests its pathways, particularly the IL-23/IL-17 axis, might be modulated by genetic variations within the IL17A and IL17F genes (Role of the IL-23/IL-17 Pathway in Rheumatic Diseases: An Overview - C. Schinocca et al., Frontiers in Immunology, 2021). However, the exact mechanisms by which these genetic variations influence IL-17 production remain poorly defined, indicating a knowledge gap in understanding personalized therapeutic approaches targeting IL-17 pathways (Role of IL‐17 in atopy—A systematic review - M. Hofmann et al., Clinical and Translational Allergy, 2021). This gap presents an opportunity to explore how genetic predispositions in IL17A and IL17F might shape IL-17 responses in various autoimmune contexts, potentially guiding the development of tailored treatments (Norcantharidin ameliorates the development of murine lupus via inhibiting the generation of IL-17 producing cells - Lifen Du et al., Acta Pharmacologica Sinica, 2021).

The role of Interleukin-17 (IL-17) in autoimmune disorders is underscored by its differential expression and regulation linked to specific genetic variations. For instance, in celiac disease (CD), elevated mucosal IL-17A levels were observed compared to gluten sensitivity, indicating a distinctive immune response potentially influenced by genetic factors (Differential Mucosal IL-17 Expression in Two Gliadin-Induced Disorders: Gluten Sensitivity and the Autoimmune Enteropathy Celiac Disease - A. Sapone et al., International Archives of Allergy and Immunology, 2009). Furthermore, IL-17's involvement in various autoimmune conditions suggests its pathways, particularly the IL-23/IL-17 axis, might be modulated by genetic variations within the IL17A and IL17F genes (Role of the IL-23/IL-17 Pathway in Rheumatic Diseases: An Overview - C.

Context Relationship: Interleukin-17 (IL-17) pathways in autoimmune disorders - influenced by genetic variations in - IL17A and IL17F genes

Papers Provided (Abstracts):
--- Paper 1: IL-17 and IL-17-producing cells in protection versus pathology ---
IL-17 cytokines drive biological responses that protect the host against many infections but can also contribute to host pathology in the context of infection and autoimmunity. Here, Kingston Mills highlights the different cellular sources of IL-17 and compares the pathological versus protective functions of these cytokines. IL-17 cytokine family members have diverse biological functions, promoting protective immunity against many pathogens but also driving inflammatory pathology during infection and autoimmunity. IL-17A and IL-17F are produced by CD4^+ and CD8^+ T cells, γδ T cells, and various innate immune cell populations in response to IL-1β and IL-23, and they mediate protective immunity against fungi and bacteria by promoting neutrophil recruitment, antimicrobial peptide production and enhanced barrier function. IL-17-driven inflammation is normally controlled by regulatory T cells and the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10, TGFβ and IL-35. However, if dysregulated, IL-17 responses can promote immunopathology in the context of infection or autoimmunity. Moreover, IL-17 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many other disorders with an inflammatory basis, including cardiovascular and neurological diseases. Consequently, the IL-17 pathway is now a key drug target in many autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders; therapeutic monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-17A, both IL-17A and IL-17F, the IL-17 receptor, or IL-23 are highly effective in some of these diseases. However, new approaches are needed to specifically regulate IL-17-mediated immunopathology in chronic inflammation and autoimmunity without compromising protective immunity to infection.

--- Paper 2: Genetic Variations of the Vitamin D Metabolic Pathway and COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity: Current Understanding and Existing Evidence ---
The immunomodulatory and metabolic effects of vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation have been considered beneficial in mitigating the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) has pleiotropic effects on the immune system that may influence inflammation associated with COVID-19. Multiple observational studies have demonstrated an association between low levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and risk and the severity of COVID-19 infection. However, the impact of vitamin D supplementation as an adjunctive treatment for COVID-19 based on evidence from randomized clinical trials is unclear. Equally important is that certain variations of the genes involved in the vitamin D metabolic pathway have been shown to affect immune function and linked with various clinical outcomes, including cardio-metabolic disorders, autoimmune diseases, infections, and cancers. This indicates inter-individual difference in body response to vitamin D. There is also emerging evidence that common polymorphisms of these genes may influence the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19, although the confidence of these findings is limited by a small number of studies and participants. Further studies are needed to address the potential role of VDR activation and DBP in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 which take into account the genetic variations of vitamin D metabolic pathway.

--- Paper 3: Commensal microbes drive intestinal inflammation by IL-17–producing CD4+ T cells through ICOSL and OX40L costimulation in the absence of B7-1 and B7-2 ---
Significance T-cell activation requires cognate antigen encounter plus additional stimulation through B7 costimulatory molecules. This explains why B7 costimulation blockade is therapeutically effective in many autoimmune disorders including diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. Interestingly, however, intestinal inflammation is uniquely resistant to B7-neutralizing therapies. We show that colonization with commensal bacteria predisposes the intestine to inflammation despite B7 deprivation caused by IL-17–producing T cells that become activated through the acces-sory costimulation molecules ICOSL and OX40L. Reciprocally, intestinal inflammation is silenced when either commensal enteric bacteria or stimulation through ICOSL/OX40L is eliminated. These results suggest that simultaneously neutralizing accessory costimulation molecules may be needed to extinguish inflammation in tissues like the intestine that retain prominent B7-independent pathways for T-cell activation. The costimulatory B7-1 (CD80)/B7-2 (CD86) molecules, along with T-cell receptor stimulation, together facilitate T-cell activation. This explains why in vivo B7 costimulation neutralization efficiently silences a variety of human autoimmune disorders. Paradoxically, however, B7 blockade also potently moderates accumulation of immune-suppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) essential for protection against multiorgan systemic autoimmunity. Here we show that B7 deprivation in mice overrides the necessity for Tregs in averting systemic autoimmunity and inflammation in extraintestinal tissues, whereas peripherally induced Tregs retained in the absence of B7 selectively mitigate intestinal inflammation caused by Th17 effector CD4+ T cells. The need for additional immune suppression in the intestine reflects commensal microbe-driven T-cell activation through the accessory costimulation molecules ICOSL and OX40L. Eradication of commensal enteric bacteria mitigates intestinal inflammation and IL-17 production triggered by Treg depletion in B7-deficient mice, whereas re-establishing intestinal colonization with Candida albicans primes expansion of Th17 cells with commensal specificity. Thus, neutralizing B7 costimulation uncovers an essential role for Tregs in selectively averting intestinal inflammation by Th17 CD4+ T cells with commensal microbe specificity.

--- Paper 4: Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the nuclear receptor RORα regulates TH17 driven inflammatory disorders ---
Full development of IL-17 producing CD4+ T helper cells (TH17 cells) requires the transcriptional activity of both orphan nuclear receptors RORα and RORγt. However, RORα is considered functionally redundant to RORγt; therefore, the function and therapeutic value of RORα in TH17 cells is unclear. Here, using mouse models of autoimmune and chronic inflammation, we show that expression of RORα is required for TH17 cell pathogenicity. T-cell-specific deletion of RORα reduces the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and colitis. Reduced inflammation is associated with decreased TH17 cell development, lower expression of tissue-homing chemokine receptors and integrins, and increased frequencies of Foxp3+ T regulatory cells. Importantly, inhibition of RORα with a selective small molecule antagonist mostly phenocopies our genetic data, showing potent suppression of the in vivo development of both chronic/progressive and relapsing/remitting EAE, but with no effect on overall thymic cellularity. Furthermore, use of the RORα antagonist effectively inhibits human TH17 cell differentiation and memory cytokine secretion. Together, these data suggest that RORα functions independent of RORγt in programming TH17 pathogenicity and identifies RORα as a safer and more selective therapeutic target for the treatment of TH17-mediated autoimmunity. Unlike RORα, which has been thought to be somewhat redundant, RORγt has been well characterized in its function and contribution to the development of Th17 cells. Here the authors show that RORα is important in Th17 differentiation and that RORα deletion or a small molecule inhibitor of RORα can reduce disease in EAE and colitis mouse models.

--- Paper 5: IL-17 Exerts Anti-Apoptotic Effect via miR-155-5p Downregulation in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis ---
Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune, neurodegenerative disease, affecting mostly young adults and resulting in progressive disability. It is a multifactorial disorder, with important involvement of both cellular and epigenetic components. Among the epigenetic factors, microRNAs are currently intensively investigated in the context of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown that their biogenesis and function may be regulated by various cytokines. IL-17, a hallmark cytokine of Th17 cells, has been thought to function predominantly as a pro-inflammatory factor, leading to increased disease symptoms. However, there are several studies indicating its protective role during inflammatory process. In this work, we have assessed the impact of high-dose IL-17 administration on microRNAs’ expression profile during the preclinical stage of EAE. For selected microRNA, we have performed computational analysis of its potential target mRNAs and cellular pathways. Based on results obtained from in silico analysis, we have chosen genes from neurotrophin signaling pathway for further experiments—BDNF, HRAS, and BCL2. Results obtained in this study suggested that high dose of IL-17 exerts protective activity via miR-155-5p downregulation. Increased expression of all studied genes, especially BCL2, indicated a potential anti-apoptotic function of IL-17 during the preclinical phase of EAE.

Research indicates that IL-17 pathways are critical in the context of autoimmune disorders, where IL-17A and IL-17F genes play significant roles. IL-17 cytokines, especially those produced by T-helper cells, are involved in promoting inflammatory responses, which can lead to immunopathology if dysregulated (K. Mills, 2022, Nature Reviews Immunology). Furthermore, the transcription factor RORα has been shown to be essential for the pathogenicity of TH17 cells, suggesting that genetic variations affecting RORα may influence IL-17-mediated autoimmunity (Ran Wang et al., 2021, Nature Communications).

Contrarily, IL-17 may also exert protective effects, as evidenced by studies showing its anti-apoptotic role during the early phases of multiple sclerosis, indicating a dual function that is possibly influenced by genetic factors (Dominika Ksiazek-Winiarek et al., 2017, Journal of Molecular Neuroscience). This duality raises questions about the influence of genetic variations in IL17A and IL17F on the dichotomy of IL-17 function in autoimmunity versus protection. There remains a gap in understanding how specific genetic polymorphisms in these genes may modulate IL-17 responses and contribute to diverse clinical outcomes in autoimmune diseases, highlighting the need for further investigation (N. Charoenngam et al., 2023, Biomedicines).

Papers Provided (Abstracts):
--- Paper 1: IL-17 in the Pathogenesis of Disease: Good Intentions Gone Awry. ---
The IL-17 family is an evolutionarily old cytokine family consisting of six members (IL-17A through IL-17F). IL-17 family cytokines signal through heterodimeric receptors that include the shared IL-17RA subunit, which is widely expressed throughout the body on both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells. The founding family member, IL-17A, is usually referred to as IL-17 and has received the most attention for proinflammatory roles in autoimmune diseases like psoriasis. However, IL-17 is associated with a wide array of diseases with perhaps surprisingly variable pathologies. This review focuses on recent advances in the roles of IL-17 during health and in disease pathogenesis. To decipher the functions of IL-17 in diverse disease processes it is useful to first consider the physiological functions that IL-17 contributes to health. We then discuss how these beneficial functions can be diverted toward pathogenic amplification of deleterious pathways driving chronic disease. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Immunology, Volume 39 is April 2021. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.

--- Paper 2: Elevated IL-17 and TGF-β Serum Levels: A Positive Correlation between T-helper 17 Cell-Related Pro-Inflammatory Responses with Major Depressive Disorder ---
Introduction: Depression is a mental disorder that highly associated with immune system. Therefore, this study compares the serum concentrations of IL-21, IL-17, and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) between patients with major depressive disorder and healthy controls. Methods: Blood samples were collected from 41 patients with major depressive disorder and 40 healthy age-matched controls with no history of malignancies or autoimmune disorders. The subjects were interviewed face to face according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Depression score was measured using completed Beck Depression Inventory in both groups. The serum concentrations of IL-21, IL-17, and TGF-β were assessed using ELISA. Results: The mean score of Beck Depression score in the patient and control groups was 35.4±5.5 and 11.1±2.3. IL-17 serum concentrations in the patients and the control group were 10.03±0.6 and 7.6±0.6 pg/mL, respectively (P=0.0002). TGF-β level in the patients group was significantly higher than compare to the control group; 336.7±20.19 vs. 174.8±27.20 pg/mL, (P<0.0001). However, the level of IL-21 was not statistically different between the two groups 84.30±4.57 vs. 84.12±4.15 pg/mL (P>0.05). Conclusion: Considering pro-inflammatory cytokines, current results support the association of inflammatory response and depressive disorder. So, it seems that pro-inflammatory factors profile can be used as indicator in following of depression progress and its treatment impacts.

--- Paper 3: IL‐17 in inflammatory skin diseases psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa ---
The skin is one of the most important organs in the body, providing integrity and acting as a barrier to exclude microbes, allergens and chemicals. However, chronic skin inflammation can result when barrier function is defective and immune responses are dysregulated or misdirected against harmless or self‐antigens. During the last 15 years interleukin (IL)‐17 cytokines have emerged as key players in multiple inflammatory disorders, and they appear to be especially prominent in skin inflammation. IL‐17 cytokines produced by T cells and other cell types potently activate keratinocytes to promote inflammation in a feed‐forward loop. Given this key pathogenic role of the IL‐17 pathway in autoimmune and inflammatory disease, it has been the focus of intense efforts to target therapeutically. The inflammatory effects of IL‐17 can be targeted directly by blocking the cytokine or its receptor, or indirectly by blocking cytokines upstream of IL‐17‐producing cells. Psoriasis has been the major success story for anti‐IL‐17 drugs, where they have proven more effective than in other indications. Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is another inflammatory skin disease which, despite carrying a higher burden than psoriasis, is poorly recognized and under‐diagnosed, and current treatment options are inadequate. Recently, a key role for the IL‐17 pathway in the pathogenesis of HS has emerged, prompting clinical trials with a variety of IL‐17 inhibitors. In this review, we discuss the roles of IL‐17A, IL‐17F and IL‐17C in psoriasis and HS and the strategies taken to target the IL‐17 pathway therapeutically.

--- Paper 4: mTORC1 signaling and IL‐17 expression: Defining pathways and possible therapeutic targets ---
IL‐17 mediates immune responses against extracellular pathogens, and it is associated with the development and pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases. The expression of IL‐17 is regulated by various intracellular signaling cascades. Recently, it has been shown that mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, comprised mainly of mTORC1 signaling, plays a critical role in IL‐17 expression. Here, we review the current knowledge regarding mechanisms by which mTORC1 regulates IL‐17 expression. mTORC1 positively modulates IL‐17 expression through several pathways, i.e. STAT3, ‐HIF‐1α, ‐S6K1, and ‐S6K2. Amino acids (AAs) also regulate IL‐17 expression by being the energy source for Th17 cells, and by activating mTORC1 signaling. Altogether, the AA‐mTORC1‐IL‐17 axis has broad therapeutic implications for IL‐17‐associated diseases, such as EAE, allergies, and colitis.

--- Paper 5: The TNF/IL‐23/IL‐17 axis—Head‐to‐head trials comparing different biologics in psoriasis treatment ---
Psoriasis is a T cell–mediated disease with autoimmune characteristics modulated by genetic susceptibility along with environmental triggers. Inflammatory pathways marked with excessive production of cytokines IL‐12 and IL‐23, drive differentiation of pathogenic T cell responses resulting in TNF and IL‐17 production. These cytokines are an integral part of the TNF/IL‐23/IL‐17 axis, which is responsible for maintaining inflammation in psoriatic skin. Our improved understanding of the immunopathogenesis led to the development of biological drugs in the treatment of moderate‐to‐severe disease. Biologics have revolutionized the management of psoriasis, highlighting the central role of TNF/IL‐23/IL‐17 axis in the physiopathology of the disease. Still, psoriasis usually requires long‐term treatment, aiming to fully remove psoriatic lesions without experiencing adverse events. In this review, we discuss the recent findings of all 27 available head‐to‐head trials investigating the efficacy and safety of systemic and biologic therapies in moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis vulgaris, as it is thought to provide more useful knowledge than placebo intervention alone. According to our evaluation, inhibitors that specifically target IL‐23 or IL‐17 are clinically more beneficial than inhibitors of IL‐12/IL‐23 and TNF. More informative results might be obtained by comparing these more efficient biological agents to each other. In addition, newer therapies for psoriasis using small‐molecule drugs may represent important advances compared to well‐established biologics as these are less expensive and orally administered.

The role of interleukin-17 (IL-17) in autoimmune disorders is significantly evident, with IL-17 pathways often being activated in these conditions. For instance, one study indicates that the IL-17 pathway is a critical player in various inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa, suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway contributes to autoimmune pathology (IL‐17 in inflammatory skin diseases psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa, J. Fletcher et al., Clinical and Experimental Immunology, 2020). Elevated levels of IL-17 have been correlated with major depressive disorder, proposing that pro-inflammatory responses mediated by IL-17 may also intersect with mood disorders, which highlights an intriguing area for further exploration (Elevated IL-17 and TGF-β Serum Levels: A Positive Correlation between T-helper 17 Cell-Related Pro-Inflammatory Responses with Major Depressive Disorder, M. Davami et al., Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, 2016).

Apart from cytokine involvement, research has pointed to intracellular signaling pathways such as mTORC1 that regulate IL-17 expression, reinforcing the need to understand how these pathways could be influenced by epigenetic modifications, including histone acetylation (mTORC1 signaling and IL‐17 expression: Defining pathways and possible therapeutic targets, W.

However, while these studies provide insights into the relationship between IL-17, autoimmune disorders, and regulatory pathways, there remains a knowledge gap regarding the specific impact of epigenetic modifications on IL-17 activation and its implications for therapeutic interventions in these diseases (IL-17 in the Pathogenesis of Disease: Good Intentions Gone Awry, Saikat Majumder et al., Annual Review of Immunology, 2021).

--- Paper 1: Enigma of IL-17 and Th17 Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis and in Autoimmune Animal Models of Arthritis ---
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common autoimmune disorders characterized by the chronic and progressive inflammation of various organs, most notably the synovia of joints leading to joint destruction, a shorter life expectancy, and reduced quality of life. Although we have substantial information about the pathophysiology of the disease with various groups of immune cells and soluble mediators identified to participate in the pathogenesis, several aspects of the altered immune functions and regulation in RA remain controversial. Animal models are especially useful in such scenarios. Recently research focused on IL-17 and IL-17 producing cells in various inflammatory diseases such as in RA and in different rodent models of RA. These studies provided occasionally contradictory results with IL-17 being more prominent in some of the models than in others; the findings of such experimental setups were sometimes inconclusive compared to the human data. The aim of this review is to summarize briefly the recent advancements on the role of IL-17, particularly in the different rodent models of RA.

IL-17 cytokines drive biological responses that protect the host against many infections but can also contribute to host pathology in the context of infection and autoimmunity. Here, Kingston Mills highlights the different cellular sources of IL-17 and compares the pathological versus protective functions of these cytokines. IL-17 cytokine family members have diverse biological functions, promoting protective immunity against many pathogens but also driving inflammatory pathology during infection and autoimmunity. IL-17A and IL-17F are produced by CD4^+ and CD8^+ T cells, γδ T cells, and various innate immune cell populations in response to IL-1β and IL-23, and they mediate protective immunity against fungi and bacteria by promoting neutrophil recruitment, antimicrobial peptide production and enhanced barrier function. IL-17-driven inflammation is normally controlled by regulatory T cells and the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10, TGFβ and IL-35. However, if dysregulated, IL-17 responses can promote immunopathology in the context of infection or autoimmunity. Moreover, IL-17 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many other disorders with an inflammatory basis, including cardiovascular and neurological diseases. Consequently, the IL-17 pathway is now a key drug target in many autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders; therapeutic monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-17A, both IL-17A and IL-17F, the IL-17 receptor, or IL-23 are highly effective in some of these diseases. However, new approaches are needed to specifically regulate IL-17-mediated immunopathology in chronic inflammation and autoimmunity without compromising protective immunity to infection.

--- Paper 3: The IL-17 family in diseases: from bench to bedside ---
The interleukin-17 (IL-17) family comprises six members (IL-17A–17F), and recently, all of its related receptors have been discovered. IL-17 was first discovered approximately 30 years ago. Members of this family have various biological functions, including driving an inflammatory cascade during infections and autoimmune diseases, as well as boosting protective immunity against various pathogens. IL-17 is a highly versatile proinflammatory cytokine necessary for vital processes including host immune defenses, tissue repair, inflammatory disease pathogenesis, and cancer progression. However, how IL-17 performs these functions remains controversial. The multifunctional properties of IL-17 have attracted research interest, and emerging data have gradually improved our understanding of the IL-17 signaling pathway. However, a comprehensive review is required to understand its role in both host defense functions and pathogenesis in the body. This review can aid researchers in better understanding the mechanisms underlying IL-17’s roles in vivo and provide a theoretical basis for future studies aiming to regulate IL-17 expression and function. This review discusses recent progress in understanding the IL-17 signaling pathway and its physiological roles. In addition, we present the mechanism underlying IL-17’s role in various pathologies, particularly, in IL-17-induced systemic lupus erythematosus and IL-17-related tumor cell transformation and metastasis. In addition, we have briefly discussed promising developments in the diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune diseases and tumors.

--- Paper 4: Blocking IL-17: A Promising Strategy in the Treatment of Systemic Rheumatic Diseases ---
Systemic rheumatic diseases are a heterogeneous group of autoimmune disorders that affect the connective tissue, characterized by the involvement of multiple organs, leading to disability, organ failure and premature mortality. Despite the advances in recent years, the therapeutic options for these diseases are still limited and some patients do not respond to the current treatments. Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a cytokine essential in the defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi. Disruption of IL-17 homeostasis has been associated with the development and progression of rheumatic diseases, and the approval of different biological therapies targeting IL-17 for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) has highlighted the key role of this cytokine. IL-17 has been also implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic rheumatic diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) and systemic sclerosis (SSc). The aim of this review is to summarize and discuss the most recent findings about the pathogenic role of IL-17 in systemic rheumatic and its potential use as a therapeutic option.

--- Paper 5: The Role of IL-17 and Th17 Lymphocytes in Autoimmune Diseases ---
The end of twentieth century has introduced some changes into T helper (Th) cells division. The identification of the new subpopulation of T helper cells producing IL-17 modified model of Th1–Th2 paradigm and it was named Th17. High abilities to stimulate acute and chronic inflammation made these cells ideal candidate for crucial player in development of autoimmune disorders. Numerous publications based on animal and human models confirmed their pivotal role in pathogenesis of human systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases. These findings made Th17 cells and pathways regulating their development and function a good target for therapy. Therapies based on inhibition of Th17-dependent pathways are associated with clinical benefits, but on the other hand are frequently inducing adverse effects. In this review, we attempt to summarize researches focused on the importance of Th17 cells in development of human autoimmune diseases as well as effectiveness of targeting IL-17 and its pathways in pre-clinical and clinical studies.

The relationship between IL-17 pathways and autoimmune disorders is underscored by the pivotal role of IL-17-producing cells, particularly Th17 cells, in driving inflammation associated with these conditions. IL-17 is essential in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and systemic sclerosis, indicating that modulation of IL-17 activity through epigenetic mechanisms, including histone acetylation, could be critical for therapeutic strategies (Enigma of IL-17 and Th17 Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis and in Autoimmune Animal Models of Arthritis; The Role of IL-17 and Th17 Lymphocytes in Autoimmune Diseases). Notably, while the IL-17 signaling pathway promotes protective immunity, its dysregulation leads to inflammatory disorders, suggesting that epigenetic modifications might play a dual role in enhancing both protective and pathological outcomes in autoimmunity (IL-17 and IL-17-producing cells in protection versus pathology; The IL-17 family in diseases: from bench to bedside). However, the potential impact of specific epigenetic changes on IL-17 production and function remains inadequately explored, presenting a knowledge gap for future research aimed at uncovering how these modifications specifically influence IL-17-driven pathologies (Blocking IL-17: A Promising Strategy in the Treatment of Systemic Rheumatic Diseases). The therapeutic implications of targeting these pathways underscore the need for innovative approaches that address the complex interplay of IL-17 activity and histone acetylation in autoimmune disease (The IL-17 family in diseases: from bench to bedside; Blocking IL-17: A Promising Strategy in the Treatment of Systemic Rheumatic Diseases).

Context Relationship: Interleukin-17 (IL-17) pathways in autoimmune disorders - activation elevated by - epigenetic modifications impacting histone acetylation

Papers Provided (Abstracts):
--- Paper 1: Differential Mucosal IL-17 Expression in Two Gliadin-Induced Disorders: Gluten Sensitivity and the Autoimmune Enteropathy Celiac Disease ---
Background: The immune-mediated enteropathy, celiac disease (CD), and gluten sensitivity (GS) are two distinct clinical conditions that are both triggered by the ingestion of wheat gliadin. CD, but not GS, is associated with and possibly mediated by an autoimmune process. Recent studies show that gliadin may induce the activation of IL-17-producing T cells and that IL-17 expression in the CD mucosa correlates with gluten intake. Methods: The small-intestinal mucosa of patients with CD and GS and dyspeptic controls was analyzed for expression of IL-17A mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR. The number of CD3+ and TCR-γδ lymphocytes and the proportion of CD3+ cells coexpressing the Th17 marker CCR6 were examined by in situ small-intestinal immunohistochemistry. Results: Mucosal expression of IL-17A was significantly increased in CD but not in GS patients, compared to controls. This difference was due to enhanced IL-17A levels in >50% of CD patients, with the remainder expressing levels similar to GS patients or controls, and was paralleled by a trend toward increased proportions of CD3+CCR6+ cells in intestinal mucosal specimens from these subjects. Conclusion: We conclude that GS, albeit gluten-induced, is different from CD not only with respect to the genetic makeup and clinical and functional parameters, but also with respect to the nature of the immune response. Our findings also suggest that two subgroups of CD, IL-17-dependent and IL-17-independent, may be identified based on differential mucosal expression of this cytokine.

--- Paper 2: The m6A reader IMP2 directs autoimmune inflammation through an IL-17– and TNFα-dependent C/EBP transcription factor axis ---
The m6A “reader” IMP2 promotes cytokine-induced kidney autoimmunity by posttranscriptional control of C/EBPβ/δ transcription factors. IL-17 makes its m6A marks IL-17 and related cytokines not only support host defense against certain pathogens but also contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases. A holistic understanding of how IL-17 initiates and propagates inflammation is needed to identify additional therapeutic opportunities in autoimmunity. Bechara et al. probed the role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications of IL-17–induced transcripts in enhancing their stability and translation. Epitranscriptomic m6A marks were detected on the mRNAs for the C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ transcription factors involved in IL-17 signaling. The noncanonical m6A reader protein IMP2 was implicated in binding these m6A marks. Mice lacking IMP2 were less susceptible to an autoantibody-induced model of kidney disease driven by IL-17 signaling. These findings establish posttranscriptional modifications of mRNAs involved in proinflammatory cytokine signaling as potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Excessive cytokine activity underlies many autoimmune conditions, particularly through the interleukin-17 (IL-17) and tumor necrosis factor–α (TNFα) signaling axis. Both cytokines activate nuclear factor κB, but appropriate induction of downstream effector genes requires coordinated activation of other transcription factors, notably, CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs). Here, we demonstrate the unexpected involvement of a posttranscriptional “epitranscriptomic” mRNA modification [N6-methyladenosine (m6A)] in regulating C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ in response to IL-17A, as well as IL-17F and TNFα. Prompted by the observation that C/EBPβ/δ-encoding transcripts contain m6A consensus sites, we show that Cebpd and Cebpb mRNAs are subject to m6A modification. Induction of C/EBPs is enhanced by an m6A methylase “writer” and suppressed by a demethylase “eraser.” The only m6A “reader” found to be involved in this pathway was IGF2BP2 (IMP2), and IMP2 occupancy of Cebpd and Cebpb mRNA was enhanced by m6A modification. IMP2 facilitated IL-17–mediated Cebpd mRNA stabilization and promoted translation of C/EBPβ/δ in response to IL-17A, IL-17F, and TNFα. RNA sequencing revealed transcriptome-wide IL-17–induced transcripts that are IMP2 influenced, and RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing identified the subset of mRNAs that are directly occupied by IMP2, which included Cebpb and Cebpd. Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2), a hallmark of autoimmune kidney injury, was strongly dependent on IL-17, IMP2, and C/EBPβ/δ. Imp2−/− mice were resistant to autoantibody-induced glomerulonephritis (AGN), showing impaired renal expression of C/EBPs and Lcn2. Moreover, IMP2 deletion initiated only after AGN onset ameliorated disease. Thus, posttranscriptional regulation of C/EBPs through m6A/IMP2 represents a previously unidentified paradigm of cytokine-driven autoimmune inflammation.

--- Paper 3: The emerging role of epigenetics in human autoimmune disorders ---
Epigenetic pathways play a pivotal role in the development and function of the immune system. Over the last decade, a growing body of studies has been published out seeking to explain a correlation between epigenetic modifications and the development of autoimmune disorders. Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs, are involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases mainly by regulating gene expression. This paper reviews the importance of epigenetic alterations during the development of the most prevalent human autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic sclerosis (SSc), Sjogren’s syndrome (SS), autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD), and type 1 diabetes (T1D), aiming to provide new insights in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and the possibility to develop novel therapeutic approaches targeting the epigenome.

--- Paper 4: IL-38: A New Player in Inflammatory Autoimmune Disorders ---
Interleukin (IL)-38, a newly discovered IL-1 family cytokine, is expressed in several tissues and secreted by various cells. IL-38 has recently been reported to exert an anti-inflammatory function by binding to several receptors, including interleukin-36 receptor (IL-36R), interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein-like 1 (IL-1RAPL1), and interleukin-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) to block binding with other pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibit subsequent signaling pathways; thereby regulating the differentiation and function of T cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Inflammatory autoimmune diseases, which are common immune-mediated inflammatory syndromes, are characterized by an imbalance between T helper cells (Ths), especially Th1s and Th17s, and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Recent findings have shown that abnormal expression of IL-38 in inflammatory autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, primary Sjogren’s syndrome, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, hidradenitis suppurativa, ankylosing spondylitis, and glaucoma, involves Th1s, Th17s, and Tregs. In this review, the expression, regulation, and biological function of IL-38 are discussed, as are the roles of IL-38 in various inflammatory autoimmune disorders. Current data support that the IL-38/IL-36R and/or IL-38/IL-1RAPL1 axis primarily play an anti-inflammatory role in the development and resolution of inflammatory autoimmune diseases and indicate a possible therapeutic benefit of IL-38 in these diseases.

IL‐17 and IL‐22 are tissue‐signaling cytokines that favor protection and regeneration of barrier organs such as the skin, lung, and gastrointestinal system. Both cytokines share cellular sources, signaling pathways, and functional aspects; however, taking a closer look they differ, e.g. in their pro‐inflammatory or regenerative potential. An imbalance of the carefully orchestrated tissue‐signaling system might result in autoimmune diseases, promote cancer growth, or predispose to infectious diseases. This review highlights recent understandings in cellular sources, signaling mechanisms, physiologic as well as pathogenic role of the double‐faceted cytokines IL‐17 and IL‐22.

The involvement of epigenetic modifications, particularly concerning histone acetylation, appears significant in the modulation of IL-17 pathways in autoimmune disorders. Bechara et al. highlighted how posttranscriptional modifications, specifically N6-methyladenosine (m6A), enhance the stability and translation of IL-17-induced transcripts that influence cytokine activity in autoimmune conditions (The m6A reader IMP2 directs autoimmune inflammation through an IL-17– and TNFα-dependent C/EBP transcription factor axis).

These findings suggest potential therapeutic interventions targeting epigenetic modifications to alter IL-17 signaling pathways in autoimmune diseases, indicating a rich area for further exploration. The compounds and mechanisms mediating these interactions remain under-investigated, which presents an opportunity for novel hypotheses regarding the link between epigenetics and IL-17 mediated autoimmune responses.

--- Paper 1: Lactobacillus casei LH23 modulates the immune response and ameliorates DSS-induced colitis via suppressing JNK/p-38 signal pathways and enhancing histone H3K9 acetylation. ---
Probiotics are thought to have immunomodulatory functions, improve inflammatory disorders and treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here, we screened a new probiotic strain with anti-inflammatory activity and investigated its effect on the immune cell response and histone acetylation. Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) LH23 inhibited the production of nitric oxide and inflammatory factors induced by lipopolysaccharides in RAW264.7 cells, which was associated with inhibiting the over-activation of the JNK/p38 signaling pathway. Furthermore, L. casei LH23 can significantly ameliorate dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse colitis in vivo by reducing numbers of macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+) and their secreted inflammatory cytokines. Myeloperoxidase activity was also decreased in mice treated with LH23. The administration of L. casei LH23 induced the increase of CD3+CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells among mesenteric lymph nodes. Meanwhile, LH23 treatment could augment short chain fatty acid contents. Importantly, we reported here for the first time that DSS treatment significantly decreased the level of histone H3K9 acetylation, while supplementation of L. casei LH23 restored the level of histone H3K9 acetylation in colon tissues. These data suggest that L. casei LH23 may have been beneficial for preventing and treating IBD.

--- Paper 2: Butyrate drives the acetylation of histone H3K9 to activate steroidogenesis through PPARγ and PGC1α pathways in ovarian granulosa cells ---
Maintaining ovarian steroidogenesis is of critical importance, considering that steroid hormones are required for successful establishment and maintenance of pregnancy and proper development of embryos and fetuses. Investigating the mechanism that butyrate modulates the ovarian steroidogenesis is beneficial for understanding the impact of lipid nutrition on steroidogenesis. Herein, we identified that butyrate improved estradiol and progesterone synthesis in rat primary ovarian granulosa cells and human granulosa KGN cells and discovered the related mechanism. Our data indicated that butyrate was sensed by GPR41 and GPR43 in ovarian granulosa cells. Butyrate primarily upregulated the acetylation of histone H3K9 (H3K9ac). Chromatin immune‐precipitation and sequencing (ChIP‐seq) data of H3K9ac revealed the influenced pathways involving in the mitochondrial function (including cellular metabolism and steroidogenesis) and cellular antioxidant capacity. Additionally, increasing H3K9ac by butyrate further stimulated the PPARγ/CD36/StAR pathways to increase ovarian steroidogenesis and activated PGC1α to enhance mitochondrial dynamics and alleviate oxidative damage. The improvement in antioxidant capacity and mitochondrial dynamics by butyrate enhanced ovarian steroidogenesis. Collectively, butyrate triggers histone H3K9ac to activate steroidogenesis through PPARγ and PGC1α pathways in ovarian granulosa cells.

--- Paper 3: Metabolic Reprogramming in Immune Response and Tissue Inflammation ---
Innate and adaptive immunity participate in and regulate numerous human diseases. Increasing evidence implies that metabolic reprogramming mediates immune cell functional changes during immune responses. In this review, we present and discuss our current understanding of metabolic regulation in different immune cells and their subsets in response to pathological stimuli. An interactive biochemical and molecular model was established to characterize metabolic reprogramming and their functional implication in anti-inflammatory, immune resolution, and proinflammatory responses. We summarize 2 major features of metabolic reprogramming in inflammatory stages in innate and adaptive immune cells: (1) energy production and biosynthesis reprogramming, including increased glycolysis and decreased oxidative phosphorylation, to secure faster ATP production and biosynthesis for defense response and damage repair and (2) epigenetic reprogramming, including enhanced histone acetylation and suppressed DNA methylation, due to altered accessibility of acetyl/methyl group donor and metabolite-modulated enzymatic activity. Finally, we discuss current strategies of metabolic and epigenetic therapy in cardiovascular disease and recommend cell-specific metabolic and gene-targeted site-specific epigenetic alterations for future therapies.

--- Paper 4: HDAC Inhibition as Potential Therapeutic Strategy to Restore the Deregulated Immune Response in Severe COVID-19 ---
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact worldwide and has been a great challenge for the scientific community. Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are now efficiently lessening COVID-19 mortality, although finding a cure for this infection is still a priority. An unbalanced immune response and the uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines are features of COVID-19 pathophysiology and contribute to disease progression and worsening. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have gained interest in immunology, as they regulate the innate and adaptative immune response at different levels. Inhibitors of these enzymes have already proven therapeutic potential in cancer and are currently being investigated for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. We thus tested the effects of different HDAC inhibitors, with a focus on a selective HDAC6 inhibitor, on immune and epithelial cells in in vitro models that mimic cells activation after viral infection. Our data indicate that HDAC inhibitors reduce cytokines release by airway epithelial cells, monocytes and macrophages. This anti-inflammatory effect occurs together with the reduction of monocytes activation and T cell exhaustion and with an increase of T cell differentiation towards a T central memory phenotype. Moreover, HDAC inhibitors hinder IFN-I expression and downstream effects in both airway epithelial cells and immune cells, thus potentially counteracting the negative effects promoted in critical COVID-19 patients by the late or persistent IFN-I pathway activation. All these data suggest that an epigenetic therapeutic approach based on HDAC inhibitors represents a promising pharmacological treatment for severe COVID-19 patients.

--- Paper 5: Glucocorticoid receptor signaling represses the antioxidant response by inhibiting histone acetylation mediated by the transcriptional activator NRF2 ---
NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) is a key transcriptional activator that mediates the inducible expression of antioxidant genes. NRF2 is normally ubiquitinated by KEAP1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) and subsequently degraded by proteasomes. Inactivation of KEAP1 by oxidative stress or electrophilic chemicals allows NRF2 to activate transcription through binding to antioxidant response elements (AREs) and recruiting histone acetyltransferase CBP (CREB-binding protein). Whereas KEAP1-dependent regulation is a major determinant of NRF2 activity, NRF2-mediated transcriptional activation varies from context to context, suggesting that other intracellular signaling cascades may impact NRF2 function. To identify a signaling pathway that modifies NRF2 activity, we immunoprecipitated endogenous NRF2 and its interacting proteins from mouse liver and identified glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as a novel NRF2-binding partner. We found that glucocorticoids, dexamethasone and betamethasone, antagonize diethyl maleate-induced activation of NRF2 target genes in a GR-dependent manner. Dexamethasone treatment enhanced GR recruitment to AREs without affecting chromatin binding of NRF2, resulting in the inhibition of CBP recruitment and histone acetylation at AREs. This repressive effect was canceled by the addition of histone deacetylase inhibitors. Thus, GR signaling decreases NRF2 transcriptional activation through reducing the NRF2-dependent histone acetylation. Consistent with these observations, GR signaling blocked NRF2-mediated cytoprotection from oxidative stress. This study suggests that an impaired antioxidant response by NRF2 and a resulting decrease in cellular antioxidant capacity account for the side effects of glucocorticoids, providing a novel viewpoint for the pathogenesis of hypercorticosteroidism.

The abstracts suggest a complex interplay between epigenetic modifications, specifically histone acetylation, and various factors influencing immune responses, though direct connections to microRNAs (miRNAs) are not explicitly outlined. Lactobacillus casei LH23 was shown to enhance histone H3K9 acetylation, which correlated with an improved immune response in a colitis model, implying that microbial activity could modulate histone acetylation and thereby influence immune functions (Lactobacillus casei LH23 modulates the immune response and ameliorates DSS-induced colitis via suppressing JNK/p-38 signal pathways and enhancing histone H3K9 acetylation). Additionally, butyrate was demonstrated to increase histone H3K9 acetylation, driving steroidogenesis and suggesting that metabolic regulators could affect histone modifications relevant to immune function (Butyrate drives the acetylation of histone H3K9 to activate steroidogenesis through PPARγ and PGC1α pathways in ovarian granulosa cells). Furthermore, the review on metabolic reprogramming discusses epigenetic reprogramming as a broader mechanism in immune cells, indicating that alterations in histone acetylation occur in response to immune challenges (Metabolic Reprogramming in Immune Response and Tissue Inflammation). 

However, a gap remains in directly linking miRNA activity to these processes, despite their known role in regulating immune responses. Further research could explore how specific miRNAs might regulate the activities of histone acetyltransferases or deacetylases in immune contexts, addressing this knowledge gap and potentially leading to new therapeutic avenues for manipulating immune responses through epigenetic modifications.

--- Paper 1: Histone acetylation promotes long-lasting defense responses and longevity following early life heat stress ---
Early exposure to some mild stresses can slow down the aging process and extend lifespan, raising the question of how early life stress might impact the somatic health of aged animals. Here, we reveal that early life heat experience triggers the establishment of epigenetic memory in soma, which promotes long-lasting stress responses and longevity in C. elegans. Unlike lethal heat shock, mild heat activates a unique transcriptional program mimicking pathogen defense responses, characterized by the enhanced expression of innate immune and detoxification genes. Surprisingly, the expression of defense response genes persists long after heat exposure, conferring enhanced stress resistance even in aged animals. Further studies identify the histone acetyltransferase CBP-1 and the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex as epigenetic modulators of the long-lasting defense responses. Histone acetylation is elevated by heat stress and maintained into agedness thereafter. Accordingly, histone acetylation levels were increased on the promoters of defense genes. Moreover, disruption of epigenetic memory abrogates the longevity response to early hormetic heat stress, indicating that long-lasting defense responses are crucial for the survival of aged animals. Together, our findings provide mechanistic insights into how temperature stress experienced in early life provides animals with lifetime health benefits.

--- Paper 2: Effects of Sodium Butyrate Treatment on Histone Modifications and the Expression of Genes Related to Epigenetic Regulatory Mechanisms and Immune Response in European Sea Bass (Dicentrarchus Labrax) Fed a Plant-Based Diet ---
Bacteria that inhabit the epithelium of the animals’ digestive tract provide the essential biochemical pathways for fermenting otherwise indigestible dietary fibers, leading to the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Of the major SCFAs, butyrate has received particular attention due to its numerous positive effects on the health of the intestinal tract and peripheral tissues. The mechanisms of action of this four-carbon chain organic acid are different; many of these are related to its potent regulatory effect on gene expression since butyrate is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that play a predominant role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and cell function. In the present work, we investigated in the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) the effects of butyrate used as a feed additive on fish epigenetics as well as its regulatory role in mucosal protection and immune homeostasis through impact on gene expression. Seven target genes related to inflammatory response and reinforcement of the epithelial defense barrier [tnfα (tumor necrosis factor alpha) il1β, (interleukin 1beta), il-6, il-8, il-10, and muc2 (mucin 2)] and five target genes related to epigenetic modifications [dicer1(double-stranded RNA-specific endoribonuclease), ehmt2 (euchromatic histone-lysine-N-methyltransferase 2), pcgf2 (polycomb group ring finger 2), hdac11 (histone deacetylase-11), and jarid2a (jumonji)] were analyzed in fish intestine and liver. We also investigated the effect of dietary butyrate supplementation on histone acetylation, by performing an immunoblotting analysis on liver core histone extracts. Results of the eight-week-long feeding trial showed no significant differences in weight gain or SGR (specific growth rate) of sea bass that received 0.2% sodium butyrate supplementation in the diet in comparison to control fish that received a diet without Na-butyrate. Dietary butyrate led to a twofold increase in the acetylation level of histone H4 at lysine 8, but showed no effect on the histone H3 at Lys9. Moreover, two different isoforms of histone H3 that might correspond to the H3.1 and H3.2 isoforms previously found in terrestrial animals were separated on the immunoblots. The expression of four (il1 β, il8, irf1, and tnfα) out of seven analyzed genes related to mucosal protection and inflammatory response was significantly different between the two analyzed tissues but only il10 showed differences in expression due to the interaction between tissue and butyrate treatment. In addition, butyrate caused significant changes in vivo in the expression of genes related to epigenetic regulatory mechanisms such as hdac11, ehmt2, and dicer1. Statistical analysis by two-way ANOVA for these genes showed not only significant differences due to the butyrate treatment, but also due to the interaction between tissue and treatment.

--- Paper 3: Protein phosphatase 2A inactivation induces microsatellite instability, neoantigen production and immune response ---
Microsatellite-instable (MSI), a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response, is caused by mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd) that occurs through genetic or epigenetic silencing of MMR genes. Here, we report a mechanism of MMRd and demonstrate that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) deletion or inactivation converts cold microsatellite-stable (MSS) into MSI tumours through two orthogonal pathways: (i) by increasing retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation that leads to E2F and DNMT3A/3B expression with subsequent DNA methylation, and (ii) by increasing histone deacetylase (HDAC)2 phosphorylation that subsequently decreases H3K9ac levels and histone acetylation, which induces epigenetic silencing of MLH1. In mouse models of MSS and MSI colorectal cancers, triple-negative breast cancer and pancreatic cancer, PP2A inhibition triggers neoantigen production, cytotoxic T cell infiltration and ICB sensitization. Human cancer cell lines and tissue array effectively confirm these signaling pathways. These data indicate the dual involvement of PP2A inactivation in silencing MLH1 and inducing MSI. Microsatellite instability (MSI), caused by deficiency of the DNA mismatch repair system, has been associated with improved response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Here the authors show that inactivation of protein phosphatase 2A induces a MSI status, promoting cytotoxic T cell infiltration and response to ICB in pre-clinical cancer models.

--- Paper 4: Impact of prebiotics on immune response: from the bench to the clinic ---
Several preclinical and clinical studies have shown the immunomodulatory role exerted by prebiotics in regulating the immune response. In this review, we describe the mechanistic and clinical studies that decipher the cell signaling pathways implicated in the process. Prebiotic fibers are conventionally known to serve as substrate for probiotic commensal bacteria that release of short‐chain fatty acids in the intestinal tract along with several other metabolites. Subsequently, they then act on the local as well as the systemic immune cells and the gut‐associated epithelial cells, primarily through G‐protein‐coupled receptor‐mediated pathways. However, other pathways including histone deacetylase inhibition and inflammasome pathway have also been implicated in regulating the immunomodulatory effect. The prebiotics can also induce a microbiota‐independent effect by directly acting on the gut‐associated epithelial and innate immune cells through the Toll‐like receptors. The cumulative effect results in the maintenance of the epithelial barrier integrity and modulation of innate immunity through secretion of pro‐ and anti‐inflammatory cytokines, switches in macrophage polarization and function, neutrophil recruitment and migration, dendritic cell and regulatory T‐cell differentiation. Extending these in vitro and ex vivo observations, some prebiotics have been well investigated, with successful human and animal trials demonstrating the association between gut microbes and immunity biomarkers leading to improvement in health endpoints across populations. This review discusses scientific insights into the association between prebiotics, innate immunity and gut microbiome from in vitro to human oral intervention.

--- Paper 5: Sodium butyrate promotes lipopolysaccharide-induced innate immune responses by enhancing mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and histone acetylation in bovine mammary epithelial cells. ---
The innate immune response plays a crucial role in recovery from infectious diseases by promoting the clearance of pathogens. Sodium butyrate (NaB) is an energy source for cellular processes with the potential to regulate the innate immune response. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of NaB on the innate immune response in a bovine mammary alveolar cell line (MAC-T) initiated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Thus, treatments were conducted as follows: treated with 1× PBS for 24 h (control), pretreated with 1 mM NaB (optimized by cell viability assays and dose-dependent experiment) for 18 h followed by treatment of 1× PBS for 6 h (NaB), pretreated with 1× PBS for 18 h followed by stimulation with LPS (1 µg/mL) for 6 h (LPS), and pretreated with 1 mM NaB for 18 h followed by stimulation with LPS (1 µg/mL) for 6 h (NaB + LPS). Different inhibitors were also used to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Furthermore, cells were treated with NaB and heat-inactivated Escherichia coli to test the effect of NaB on transcription of genes related to the innate immune response triggered by the major causative pathogen of mastitis. Each treatment had 3 replicates and was repeated 3 times. Proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and β-defensins are crucial secretion factors in innate immunity, and transcription of these factors was increased by NaB during challenge with LPS or heat-inactivated E. coli in MAC-T cells. Acetylation of histone H3 protein, which promotes gene expression by affecting the structure of chromatin, was also upregulated by NaB in response to LPS stimulation. P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), JNK, and Erk 1 and 2 are key upstream regulators of the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and β-defensins, and their activity was enhanced by NaB during LPS stimulation. Furthermore, inhibitors were used to assess the role of MAPK signaling in the effects of NaB. The results showed that inhibitors of p38 MAPK, Erk, and JNK attenuated the NaB-induced upregulation of TNF and β-defensin 5 (DEFB5) transcription, and that the inhibitor of Erk attenuated the NaB-induced upregulation of IL1B transcription during LPS challenge. Enhanced transcription of CXCL8 by NaB was blocked by the inhibitor of Erk and p38 MAPK during LPS stimulation. Overall, NaB boosted the LPS-induced innate immune response by promoting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and β-defensins, which was associated with enhanced MAPK signaling activation and histone H3 acetylation.

The relationship between epigenetic modifications impacting histone acetylation and the activity of microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with immune response regulation is explored across several studies. For instance, sodium butyrate has been shown to elevate histone acetylation levels in response to immune challenges, suggesting a link between dietary factors and epigenetic modifications that enhance immune responses (Dai et al., 2020, Journal of Dairy Science). Additionally, the research indicates that sodium butyrate also influences gene expression related to the immune response, potentially involving regulatory mechanisms that could include miRNAs, although direct evidence linking miRNAs with histone acetylation in immune contexts is missing in the current literature (Terova et al., 2016, PLoS ONE). Another study emphasizes the role of histone deacetylase inhibition in regulating the immune response through epigenetic pathways, hinting at a broader interaction between epigenetic remodeling and immune regulation (Pujari & Banerjee, 2020, Immunology and Cell Biology). However, a clear connection involving specific miRNAs remains to be studied further, creating a gap in understanding how miRNAs may directly regulate histone acetylation in immune contexts. These insights could potentially lead to novel hypotheses exploring the specific roles of miRNAs in modulating histone acetylation and thereby influencing immune responses.

--- Paper 1: Epigenetics in Tuberculosis: Immunomodulation of Host Immune Response ---
Tuberculosis is a stern, difficult to treat chronic infection caused by acid-fast bacilli that tend to take a long time to be eradicated from the host’s environment. It requires the action of both innate and adaptive immune systems by the host. There are various pattern recognition receptors present on immune cells, which recognize foreign pathogens or its product and trigger the immune response. The epigenetic modification plays a crucial role in triggering the susceptibility of the host towards the pathogen and activating the host’s immune system against the invading pathogen. It alters the gene expression modifying the genetic material of the host’s cell. Epigenetic modification such as histone acetylation, alteration in non-coding RNA, DNA methylation and alteration in miRNA has been studied for their influence on the pathophysiology of tuberculosis to control the spread of infection. Despite several studies being conducted, many gaps still exist. Herein, we discuss the immunopathophysiological mechanism of tuberculosis, the essentials of epigenetics and the recent encroachment of epigenetics in the field of tuberculosis and its influence on the outcome and pathophysiology of the infection.

ABSTRACT Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA hypermethylation, histone acetylation/methylation, or nucleosome positioning, result in differential gene expression. These modifications can have an impact on various pathways, including host antiviral immune responses. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of epigenetic modifications induced by viruses to counteract host antiviral immune responses, which are crucial for establishing and maintaining infection of viruses. Finally, we provide insights into the potential use of epigenetic modulators in combating viral infections and virus-induced diseases.

--- Paper 3: TLR ligands, but not modulators of histone modifiers, can induce the complex immune response pattern of endotoxin tolerance in mammary epithelial cells ---
Excessive stimulation of the TLR4 axis through LPS reduces the expression of some cytokine genes in immune cells, while stimulating the expression of immune defense genes during a subsequent bacterial infection. This endotoxin tolerance (ET) is mediated via epigenetic mechanisms. Priming the udder of cows with LPS was shown to induce ET in mammary epithelial cells (MEC), thereby protecting the udder against reinfection for some time. Seeking alternatives to LPS priming we tried to elicit ET by priming MEC with either lipopeptide (Pam2CSK4) via the TLR2/6 axis or inhibitors of histone-modifying enzymes. Pre-incubation of MEC with Pam2CSK4 enhanced baseline and induced expression of bactericidal (β-defensin; SLPI) and membrane protecting factors (SAA3, TGM3), while reducing the expression of cytokine- and chemokine-encoding genes (TNF, IL1β) after a subsequent pathogen challenge, the latter, however, not as efficiently as after LPS priming. Pre-treating MEC with various inhibitors of histone H3 modifiers (for demethylation, acetylation or deacetylation) all failed to induce any of the protective factors and only resulted in some dampening of cytokine gene expression after the re-challenge. Hence, triggering immune functions via the TLR axis, but not through those histone modifiers, induced the beneficial phenomenon of ET in MEC.

--- Paper 4: Epigenetic Drugs for Cancer and microRNAs: A Focus on Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors ---
Over recent decades, it has become clear that epigenetic abnormalities are involved in the hallmarks of cancer. Histone modifications, such as acetylation, play a crucial role in cancer development and progression, by regulating gene expression, such as for oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Therefore, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have recently shown efficacy against both hematological and solid cancers. Designed to target histone deacetylases (HDAC), these drugs can modify the expression pattern of numerous genes including those coding for micro-RNAs (miRNA). miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by targeting messenger RNA. Current research has found that miRNAs from a tumor can be investigated in the tumor itself, as well as in patient body fluids. In this review, we summarized current knowledge about HDAC and HDACi in several cancers, and described their impact on miRNA expression. We discuss briefly how circulating miRNAs may be used as biomarkers of HDACi response and used to investigate response to treatment.

--- Paper 5: Histone‐deacetylase 8 drives the immune response and the growth of glioma ---
Many epigenetic modifications occur in glioma, in particular the histone‐deacetylase class proteins play a pivotal role in glioma development, driving the proliferation rate and the invasiveness of tumor cells, and modulating the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we evaluated the role of the histone deacetylase HDAC8 in the regulation of the immune response in glioma and tumor growth. We found that inhibition of HDAC8 by the specific inhibitor PCI‐34051 reduces tumor volume in glioma mouse models. We reported that HDAC8 modulates the viability and the migration of human and murine glioma cells. Interestingly, HDAC8 inhibition increases the acetylation of alpha‐tubulin, suggesting this epigenetic modification controls glioma migration. Furthermore, we identify HDAC8 as a key molecule that supports a poorly immunogenic tumor microenvironment, modulating microglial phenotype and regulating the gene transcription of NKG2D ligands that trigger the Natural Killer cell‐mediated cytotoxicity of tumor cells. Altogether, these results identify HDAC8 as a key actor in glioma growth and tumor microenvironment, and pave the way to a better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of immune escape in glioma.

Recent studies indicate a significant relationship between epigenetic modifications, particularly histone acetylation, and the regulation of immune responses by microRNAs (miRNAs). The review on tuberculosis highlights how epigenetic modifications, including alterations in miRNA, influence the host's immune response to infections (Khadela et al., 2022, Vaccines). Similarly, the research on histone deacetylase inhibitors emphasizes that these agents can modify miRNA expression, suggesting that miRNA may play a crucial role in regulating histone acetylation patterns during immune responses in cancer (Autin et al., 2019, Cancers). Additionally, the role of HDAC8 in glioma underscores the potential link between histone modifications and immune escape mechanisms, where miRNAs could be implicated in the modulation of this epigenetic landscape (Mormino et al., 2021, Glia). However, the exact pathways connecting miRNA activity and histone acetylation in the context of immune regulation remain underexplored, representing a significant gap in the literature (Locatelli et al., 2023, Journal of Virology). These insights suggest further investigation into how miRNAs can influence histone acetylation to modulate immune responses, especially in infectious and cancer contexts.

--- Paper 1: Epigenetics in rheumatoid arthritis; fibroblast‐like synoviocytes as an emerging paradigm in the pathogenesis of the disease ---
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by immune dysfunctions and chronic inflammation that mainly affects diarthrodial joints. Genetics has long been surveyed in searching for the etiopathogenesis of the disease and partially clarified the conundrums within this context. Epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs, which have been considered to be involved in RA pathogenesis, likely explain the nongenetic risk factors. Epigenetic modifications may influence RA through fibroblast‐like synoviocytes (FLSs). It has been shown that FLSs play an essential role in the onset and exacerbation of RA, and therefore, they may illustrate some aspects of RA pathogenesis. These cells exhibit a unique DNA methylation profile in the early stage of the disease that changes with disease progression. Histone acetylation profile in RA FLSs is disrupted through the imbalance of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylase activity. Furthermore, dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is immense. Most of these miRNAs have shown an aberrant expression in FLSs that are involved in proliferation and cytokine production. Besides, dysregulation of long noncoding RNAs in FLSs has been revealed and attributed to RA pathogenesis. Further investigations are needed to get a better view of epigenetic alterations and their interactions. We also discuss the role of these epigenetic alterations in RA pathogenesis and their therapeutic potential.

--- Paper 2: Inhibition of histone H3K27 demethylases selectively modulates inflammatory phenotypes of natural killer cells ---
Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes, important in immune surveillance and elimination of stressed, transformed, or virus-infected cells. They critically shape the inflammatory cytokine environment to orchestrate interactions of cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Some studies have reported that NK cell activation and cytokine secretion are controlled epigenetically but have yielded only limited insight into the mechanisms. Using chemical screening with small-molecule inhibitors of chromatin methylation and acetylation, further validated by knockdown approaches, we here identified Jumonji-type histone H3K27 demethylases as key regulators of cytokine production in human NK cell subsets. The prototypic JMJD3/UTX (Jumonji domain–containing protein 3) H3K27 demethylase inhibitor GSK-J4 increased global levels of the repressive H3K27me3 mark around transcription start sites of effector cytokine genes. Moreover, GSK-J4 reduced IFN-γ, TNFα, granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interleukin-10 levels in cytokine-stimulated NK cells while sparing their cytotoxic killing activity against cancer cells. The anti-inflammatory effect of GSK-J4 in NK cell subsets, isolated from peripheral blood or tissue from individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), coupled with an inhibitory effect on formation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, suggested that histone demethylase inhibition has broad utility for modulating immune and inflammatory responses. Overall, our results indicate that H3K27me3 is a dynamic and important epigenetic modification during NK cell activation and that JMJD3/UTX-driven H3K27 demethylation is critical for NK cell function.

--- Paper 3: The immunomodulatory effects of TNF-α inhibitors on human Th17 cells via RORγt histone acetylation ---
The presence of interleukin (IL)-17-related cytokines correlates with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis. Epigenetic modifications, including histone acetylation, regulate gene expression in RA pathogenesis. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors such as etanercept and adalimumab, represent a breakthrough in RA treatment. We aimed to investigate the effects of etanercept and adalimumab on human Th17-polarized cells and the possible intracellular regulators of these effects, including the Th17-specific transcription factors signal transducer, activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), retinoid-related orphan receptor γ-T (RORγt) and epigenetic modification. Human CD4+ T cells from healthy subjects and patients with RA were pretreated with TNF-α inhibitors and then being polarized into IL-17-producing cells. The Th17-related cytokine levels in the culture supernatants were determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Intracellular signalling was investigated by western blot, real-time RT-PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Th17-polarized cells from patients with RA produced more IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 than those from healthy subjects. Etanercept and adalimumab suppressed IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 levels in Th17-polarized cells from healthy subjects and patients with RA. Western blot analysis revealed that etanercept and adalimumab decreased mitogen-activated protein kinase-phospho-p38, nuclear factor-κB-phospho-p65, phospho-STAT3 and RORγt levels. Etanercept and adalimumab decreased histone (H)3 and H4 acetylation in the RORγt gene promotor region by decreasing the recruitment of the acetyltransferases p300, CBP and PCAF. The present study broadens our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the immunomodulatory effects of TNF-α inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis treatment.

--- Paper 4: Deletion of a Conserved cis-Element in the Ifng Locus Highlights the Role of Acute Histone Acetylation in Modulating Inducible Gene Transcription ---
Differentiation-dependent regulation of the Ifng cytokine gene locus in T helper (Th) cells has emerged as an excellent model for functional study of distal elements that control lineage-specific gene expression. We previously identified a cis-regulatory element located 22 kb upstream of the Ifng gene (Conserved Non-coding Sequence -22, or CNS-22) that is a site for recruitment of the transcription factors T-bet, Runx3, NF-κB and STAT4, which act to regulate transcription of the Ifng gene in Th1 cells. Here, we report the generation of mice with a conditional deletion of CNS-22 that has enabled us to define the epigenetic and functional consequences of its absence. Deletion of CNS-22 led to a defect in induction of Ifng by the cytokines IL-12 and IL-18, with a more modest effect on induction via T-cell receptor activation. To better understand how CNS-22 and other Ifng CNSs regulated Ifng transcription in response to these distinct stimuli, we examined activation-dependent changes in epigenetic modifications across the extended Ifng locus in CNS-22-deficient T cells. We demonstrate that in response to both cytokine and TCR driven activation signals, CNS-22 and other Ifng CNSs recruit increased activity of histone acetyl transferases (HATs) that transiently enhance levels of histones H3 and H4 acetylation across the extended Ifng locus. We also demonstrate that activation-responsive increases in histone acetylation levels are directly linked to the ability of Ifng CNSs to acutely enhance Pol II recruitment to the Ifng promoter. Finally, we show that impairment in IL-12+IL-18 dependent induction of Ifng stems from the importance of CNS-22 in coordinating locus-wide levels of histone acetylation in response to these cytokines. These findings identify a role for acute histone acetylation in the enhancer function of distal conserved cis-elements that regulate of Ifng gene expression.

--- Paper 5: Epigenetics in inflammatory rheumatic diseases. ---
Inflammatory rheumatic disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and connective tissue diseases, are characterized by chronic inflammation that generally can be overcome by lifelong administration of immunosuppressive therapies. In most of these diseases, factors of genetic predisposition have been described, in particular the influence of distinct HLA haplotypes. In addition, environmental factors, including nutrition, infection, and exposure to sunlight, have been postulated as disease-driving agents. It is, however, unclear how genetic susceptibility in concert with the factors mentioned lead to the development of disease in one individual but not in another. The successful accomplishment of the Human Genome Project, which has yielded sequences for !25,000 identified human genes, presents a challenge to biomolecular research, since most of the identified genes code for biologic functions that have yet to be discovered. The functional characterization of these genes in normal physiologic processes as well as in the pathogenesis of diseases, a concept generally referred to as functional genomics (1), remains the main issue for biomedical research in the coming years. Within the nucleus of a human cell, the DNA sequence contains !3 billion basepairs, covering most of the nonheterochromatic portions of the genome. The low number of genes detected by the Human Genome Project is, however, most surprising. Moreover, between humans and chimpanzees, a remarkable genetic similarity of nearly 99% has been reported, thus highlighting the importance of distinguishing areas of the genome that would define genetic changes unique to humans (2). The low number of genes reflects the functional impact of posttranscriptional as well as posttranslational modifications and of epigenetic alterations in creating proteome diversity. Epigenetic alterations comprise heritable modifications of the DNA without any change in the base sequence of the genetic code per se. Two major groups of epigenetic alterations have been identified, i.e., DNA methylation and histone modifications. Changes to DNA or alternative splicing of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts has a strong impact on proteome complexity, and thus the utility of genomic information is somewhat restricted by the lack of precision in predicting genes, gene structures, and alternative splices (3,4). Epigenetic alterations can be inherited; however, changes can occur over the full span of a human life. When analyzing the epigenome (the genome-wide distribution of epigenetic alterations) in homozygous twins, Farga et al found a very similar epigenetic pattern in younger twin pairs, whereas older twin pairs showed several differences in the pattern of histone acetylation and DNA methylation, particularly in those whose lifestyles were not shared (5). Currently, the epigenome is not measured systematically, and epigenetic changes have not been assessed within the Human Genome Project. For several illnesses, however, evidence indicates that they are linked to specific epigenetic processes and variations, which might provide an explanation for the late onset and strong age dependency of some diseases or the progressive nature of many common diseases (6). Moreover, it is likely that epigenetic alterations underpin the role of environmental factors in the pathogenesis of diseases in genetically susceptible individuals, and thus might broaden the scope of design of new therapeutic strategies. In this review article, we focus on the emerging concepts of epigenetics (summarized in Figure 1) as they apply to inflammatory rheumatic diseases.

Epigenetic modifications, particularly histone acetylation, play a crucial role in the regulation of inflammatory responses in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), significantly influencing the NF-κB signaling pathway. Histone acetylation profiles in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) associated with RA are disrupted due to imbalances between histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases, suggesting a direct impact on the activation of inflammatory pathways (Epigenetics in rheumatoid arthritis; fibroblast‐like synoviocytes as an emerging paradigm in the pathogenesis of the disease). Additionally, TNF-α inhibitors have been shown to decrease histone acetylation at the RORγt gene promoter region, which is linked to reduced activation of the NF-κB pathway, thus modulating inflammatory responses (The immunomodulatory effects of TNF-α inhibitors on human Th17 cells via RORγt histone acetylation). Furthermore, a study highlighted that acute histone acetylation is essential in modulating gene transcription in response to inflammatory stimuli, impacting the overall expression of cytokines, which could include those downstream of NF-κB (Deletion of a Conserved cis-Element in the Ifng Locus Highlights the Role of Acute Histone Acetylation in Modulating Inducible Gene Transcription). These findings collectively suggest a pivotal link between epigenetic modifications, histone acetylation, and the activation of the NF-κB pathway in driving inflammation in RA, but they also underline a need for further exploration of the causal relationships and underlying mechanisms (Epigenetics in inflammatory rheumatic diseases).

--- Paper 1: What can we learn from epigenetics in the year 2009? ---
Purpose of reviewRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic, autoimmune disease resulting in the destruction of affected joints. Even though current therapies with biologics such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha blockers yield significant improvement for the patients, the disease is not curable yet. Therefore, we need novel strategies for better therapies. Recent findingsThe growing knowledge of epigenetics might give us new insights into the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. In the last year, several new findings about epigenetic modifications of gene expression were reported in different arthritides. These modifications describe changes in the expression of DNA that result from methylation, posttranslational modifications of the histone proteins, including acetylation/deacetylation, sumoylation, methylation and microRNAs. Most interestingly, these modifications seem to act in concert and are associated with the circadian metabolic rhythm of cells. SummaryThis review summarizes reports from the last year about epigenetic modifications of gene expression via acetylation/deacetylation, including sirtuins, sumoylation, methylation, microRNAs in all in rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritides, providing potential strategies for better therapies and encourages the development of specific epigenetic drugs.

--- Paper 2: Epigenetic contributions in the development of rheumatoid arthritis ---
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease, characterized by chronic inflammation of the joints with severe pain and swelling, joint damage and disability, which leads to joint destruction and loss of function. Despite extensive research efforts, the underlying cause for RA is still unknown and current therapies are more or less effective in controlling symptoms but still fail to cure the disease. In recent years, epigenetic modifications were found to strongly contribute to the development of RA by affecting diverse aspects of the disease and modifying gene expression levels and behavior of several cell types, first and foremost joint resident synovial fibroblasts (SF). RASF are the most common cell type at the site of invasion. Owing to their aggressive, intrinsically activated phenotype, RASF are active contributors in joint damage. RASF are characterized by their ability to secrete cytokines, chemokines and joint-damaging enzymes. Furthermore, these cells are resistant to apoptosis, leading to hyperplasia of the synovium. In addition, RASF have invasive and migratory properties that could lead to spreading of the disease to unaffected joints. Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications, such as histone (de)acetylation, histone methylation and histone sumoylation were identified as regulatory mechanisms in controlling aggressive cell activation in vitro and in disease outcome in animal models in vivo. In the last 5 years, the field of epigenetics in RA has impressively increased. In this review we consider the role of diverse epigenetic modifications in the development of RA, with a special focus on epigenetic modifications in RASF.

--- Paper 3: Epigenetic control of influenza virus: role of H3K79 methylation in interferon-induced antiviral response ---
Influenza virus stablishes a network of virus-host functional interactions, which depends on chromatin dynamic and therefore on epigenetic modifications. Using an unbiased search, we analyzed the epigenetic changes at DNA methylation and post-translational histone modification levels induced by the infection. DNA methylation was unaltered, while we found a general decrease on histone acetylation, which correlates with transcriptional inactivation and may cooperate with the impairment of cellular transcription that causes influenza virus infection. A particular increase in H3K79 methylation was observed and the use of an inhibitor of the specific H3K79 methylase, Dot1L enzyme, or its silencing, increased influenza virus replication. The antiviral response was reduced in conditions of Dot1L downregulation, since decreased nuclear translocation of NF-kB complex, and IFN-β, Mx1 and ISG56 expression was detected. The data suggested a control of antiviral signaling by methylation of H3K79 and consequently, influenza virus replication was unaffected in IFN pathway-compromised, Dot1L-inhibited cells. H3K79 methylation also controlled replication of another potent interferon-inducing virus such as vesicular stomatitis virus, but did not modify amplification of respiratory syncytial virus that poorly induces interferon signaling. Epigenetic methylation of H3K79 might have an important role in controlling interferon-induced signaling against viral pathogens.

--- Paper 4: Inflammatory cytokines epigenetically regulate rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocyte activation by suppressing HDAC5 expression ---
Objectives Epigenetic modifications play an important role in the regulation of gene transcription and cellular function. Here, we examined if pro-inflammatory factors present in the inflamed joint of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) could regulate histone deacetylase (HDAC) expression and function in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Methods Protein acetylation in synovial tissue was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The mRNA levels of HDAC family members and inflammatory mediators in the synovial tissue and the changes in HDAC expression in RA FLS were measured by quantitative (q) PCR. FLS were either transfected with HDAC5 siRNA or transduced with adenoviral vector encoding wild-type HDAC5 and the effects of HDAC5 manipulation were examined by qPCR arrays, ELISA and ELISA-based assays. Results Synovial class I HDAC expression was associated with local expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and matrix metalloproteinase-1, while class IIa HDAC5 expression was inversely associated with parameters of disease activity (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints). Interleukin (IL)-1β or TNF stimulation selectively suppressed HDAC5 expression in RA FLS, which was sufficient and required for optimal IFNB, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 induction by IL-1β, associated with increased nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor, interferon regulatory factor 1(IRF1). Conclusions Inflammatory cytokines suppress RA FLS HDAC5 expression, promoting nuclear localisation of IRF1 and transcription of a subset of type I interferon response genes. Our results identify HDAC5 as a novel inflammatory mediator in RA, and suggest that strategies rescuing HDAC5 expression in vivo, or the development of HDAC inhibitors not affecting HDAC5 activity, may have therapeutic applications in RA treatment.

--- Paper 5: Monitoring of protein arginine deiminase activity by using fluorescence quenching: multicolor visualization of citrullination. ---
Epigenetics is driven by posttranslational modifications, such as methylation and acetylation of Arg and Lys residues. A less well publicized modification, namely conversion of Arg to citrulline (Cit), began to receive attention in the 1990s, when it was discovered that autoantibodies targeting citrulline-embedded epitopes are present in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.[1] The Arg-to-Cit conversion in histones has now been correlated with the regulation of gene expression.[2] PAD4, a member of the Protein Arginine Deiminase (PAD) enzyme family that catalyze this transformation, is overexpressed in rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, multiple sclerosis, and glaucoma.[3]Only a few assays have been described for the PAD enzyme family, including colorimetric[4], coupled[5], SDS-PAGE gel[6], affinity probe fluorescent polarization[7], and protein array[8] approaches. We describe herein a PAD4 activity fluorescence-based sensing strategy that can be employed throughout the visible spectrum and into the near infrared. The flexibility inherent within this strategy offers the ability to simultaneously monitor the activity of PAD4 along with other enzymes that modify histones. 
 
A particularly appealing biosensor design strategy employs fluorescently quenched substrates that experience relief from quenching upon conversion to product. For example, protease sensors have been designed that possess a fluorophore on one side of the scissile bond and a fluorescent quencher on the other.[9] Strategies developed for other enzymes employ fluorescent quencher molecules that are stripped away from the fluorophore-containing product.[10] It occurred to us that the PAD4-catalyzed conversion of a positively charged Arg residue (compound A) to a neutral Cit (compound C) should lead to the direct release of a noncovalently associated, negatively charged, quencher molecule (Q-) from a fluorescently quenched complex (compound B, Scheme 1). Furthermore, this strategy struck us as potentially applicable to a wide variety of fluorophores, thereby offering the flexibility to simultaneously visualize the action of PAD4 and other enzymes using wavelength-distinct sensors.[11] 
 
 
 
Scheme 1 
 
The fluorescent PAD4 substrate A forms a non-fluorescent noncovalent complex B with a negatively charged quencher dye molecule. Upon citrullination of the PAD4 substrate, the now neutral product C loses its affinity for the dye, and a fluorescent response ... 
 
 
 
We prepared the following analogs of Ac-Ser-Gly-Arg-Gly-Ala, an efficient PAD4 substrate[12]: (a) a Gly-for-Ser substitution to preclude the possibility of phosphorylation when monitoring PAD4 activity in the presence of protein kinases (vide infra); (b) multimerized versions of (Gly-Arg-Gly-Ala)n to enhance the formation of the fluorescently quenched complex B (Scheme 1); (c) N-terminal attachment of the rhodamine derivative TAMRA and subsequently, upon identification of an optimized TAMRA-(Gly-Arg-Gly-Ala)nsubstrate, other fluorophores. 
 
A library of 47 commercially available dyes was screened against TAMRA-Gly-Arg-Gly-Ala and TAMRA-(Gly-Arg-Gly-Ala)3(2) to identify fluorescent quenchers (Supporting Information). Although TAMRA-Gly-Arg-Gly-Ala, with only a single Arg residue, is recalcitrant to significant fluorescent quenching, the fluorescence of the corresponding trimer is dramatically quenched by a variety of dyes. Several of the latter were examined for their ability to quench the fluorescence of TAMRA-(Gly-Arg-Gly-Ala)3 and generate a fluorescent enhancement upon exposure to PAD4 (Supporting Information). Our lead, Acid Green 27 (1), in combination with the peptide trimer, displays an impressive PAD4-catalyzed 57 ± 2-fold increase in fluorescence. Furthermore, the tetramer, TAMRA-(Gly-Arg-Gly-Ala)4, exhibits a 166 ± 10-fold increase in fluorescence and an analog, (Gly-Arg-Gly-Ala)2-Lys(TAMRA)-(Gly-Arg-Gly-Ala)2, displays a 138 ± 7-fold enhancement in fluorescence upon citrullination. 
 
The presumed resistance of the Cit-containing products(s) to Acid Green 27-mediated fluorescence quenching was confirmed by preparing authentic samples containing one, two, and three Cit residues. The fluorescence of Cit-containing analogs of TAMRA-GlyXaaGlyAlaGlyXaaGlyAlaGlyXaaGlyAla as a function of Acid Green 27 concentration is shown in Figure 1, where Xaa = Arg or Cit. Fluorescence quenching by Acid Green 27 is most pronounced as follows: (GRGA)3 > mono-substituted Cit > di-substituted Cit > tri-substituted Cit, supporting our hypothesis that the conversion of positively charged Arg to neutral Cit residues disrupts dye binding (Supporting Information).

Simultaneous visualization of the activity of multiple enzymes offers the possibility of concurrently monitoring the response of several biochemical pathways to environmental stimuli. However, the response of the sensor associated with each enzymatic activity must be wavelength distinct. This lead us to explore the range of fluorophores that respond to the Scheme 1 strategy, which offers an assessment of the flexibility of PAD4 assay to work in concert with reporters of other enzyme-catalyzed reactions. We prepared Fl-(GRGA)3 derivatives where Fl = DEAC (3; λem 480 nm), Oregon Green 488 (4; λem 525 nm), Cascade Yellow (5; λem 545 nm), Rox (6; λem 591 nm), Texas Red (7; λem 615 nm), and Atto 655 (8; λem 680 nm). 
 
Each Fl-(GRGA)3 derivative was screened with the quencher library (Supporting Information). With the exception of Oregon Green 488, all substrates are strongly susceptible to quenching, most notably by Acid Green 27: DEAC (49 ± 1-fold @ 480 nm) Cascade Yellow (55 ± 2-fold @ 545 nm), Rox (133 ± 9-fold @ 610 nm), Texas Red (156 ± 10-fold @ 610 nm), and Atto 655 (48 ± 5-fold @ 680 nm). 
 
The large fluorescence changes associated with the PAD4 substrates are easily visualized without sophiscated instrumentation. The DEAC, Cascade Yellow, TAMRA and Atto 655 derivatives have very different emision wavelengths and good conversion rates, and thus were selected for side-by-side photoimaging studies. With the exception of DEAC-(GRGA)3, for which a Xe flash lamp and proper filters were employed to eliminate UV light interference with the camera, fluorophore excitation was performed with a hand-held UV lamp and emission was photographed with a Vis-IR camera (Figure 2). In an analogous fashion, we captured color images directly from the spectrofluorimeter by integrating the Vis-IR camera with the sample chamber (Supporting Information).

Visualization of Fluorophore-(GRGA)3 PAD4 substrates. The DEAC-peptide was excited with a Xe Flash lamp and all others with a Hg arc lamp. Each sample set was incubated with (left) and without (right) PAD4 for 60 min prior to image capture. 
 
 
 
The diversity of fluorophores compatible with PAD4 catalysis furnishes the flexibility to assemble paired fluorescent enzyme sensors that enable simultaneous monitoring of multiple enzymatic activities. For example, histones are known to suffer a wide variety of enzyme-catalyzed modifications which, in turn, influence gene expression. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is the first enzyme shown to phosphorylate histones.[13] We paired the PAD4 TAMRA-(GRGA)3 sensor with a previously described PKA peptide-based sensor, Ac-GRTGRRDap(pyrene)SYP-amide, that reports phosphorylation via a pyrene fluorophore.[5, 6] The fluorescence changes of PAD4 and PKA substrates were monitored at 590 and 400 nm, respectively. An increase in PKA substrate fluorescence is only observed in the presence of PKA and, similarly, an increase in PAD4 substrate fluorescence is only observed in the presence of PAD4 (Figure 3). The activity of both enzymes can be simultaneously monitored and the observed activity under combined conditions for each enzyme is the same as that of the enzymes alone. Finally, we examined the ability of the molecular construct 3 to detect endogenous PAD4 activity in lysates from a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60). Since PAD4 is only found in the nucleus (confirmed by Western blot analysis; Figure 4b), we compared PAD4 activities in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts (Figure 4a). As expected, only the nuclear extract displays PAD4 activity. Furthermore, the observed deiminase activity is Ca2+-dependent and blocked by the PAD4 inhibitor minocycline, which is both consistent with and reflective of PAD4 action on sensor 3.

In summary, we have created a series of PAD4 sensors that furnish a robust fluorescent response across the visible spectrum and into the near infrared. Given the demonstrated biological and biomedical significance of multiplexing nucleic acid and protein content from cells, sensors that are tunable to specific windows throughout the visible and near IR potentially enable the simultaneous monitoring of multiple enzymatic activities.

Recent literature highlights the critical role of epigenetic modifications, particularly histone acetylation, in modulating the NF-kB pathway and its implications for inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). One study underscores that pro-inflammatory factors like IL-1β and TNF suppress the expression of histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) in RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), promoting the nuclear localization of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and enhancing the transcription of type I interferon response genes. This mechanism suggests a connection between diminished HDAC activity, augmented histone acetylation, and NF-kB pathway activation (Inhibitory Role of Histone Deacetylases in Rheumatoid Arthritis). A review emphasizes that diverse epigenetic modifications, including acetylation and deacetylation, actively influence the aggressive phenotype of rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts, implicating altered histone dynamics in disease progression and inflammatory responses (Epigenetic contributions in the development of rheumatoid arthritis). Furthermore, epigenetic mechanisms, including post-translational modifications of histones, affect gene expression levels and cellular behaviors of RA-related cell types, indicating that targeted manipulation of these modifications might offer novel therapeutic avenues (What can we learn from epigenetics in the year 2009?). Collectively, these findings point to a need for further exploration into how specific epigenetic changes can fine-tune NF-kB signaling pathways, potentially paving the way for innovative RA therapies.

--- Paper 1: Effects of Wutou Decoction on DNA Methylation and Histone Modifications in Rats with Collagen-Induced Arthritis ---
Background. Wutou decoction (WTD) has been wildly applied in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and experimental arthritis in rats for many years. Epigenetic deregulation is associated with the aetiology of rheumatoid arthritis; however, the effects of WTD on epigenetic changes are unclear. This study is set to explore the effects of WTD on DNA methylation and histone modifications in rats with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Methods. The CIA model was established by the stimulation of collagen and adjuvant. The knee synovium was stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and methylated CpG binding domain 2 (MBD2) expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were determined by Real-Time PCR. The global DNA histone H3-K4/H3-K27 methylation and total histones H3 and H4 acetylation of PBMCs were detected. Results. Our data demonstrated that the DNMT1 mRNA expression was significantly lowered in group WTD compared to that in group CIA (P < 0.05). The DNA methylation level was significantly reduced in group WTD compared to that in group CIA (P < 0.05). Moreover, H3 acetylation of PBMCs was overexpressed in WTD compared with CIA (P < 0.05). Conclusions. WTD may modulate DNA methylation and histone modifications, functioning as anti-inflammatory potential.

--- Paper 2: Short‐chain fatty acids: Bacterial messengers modulating the immunometabolism of T cells ---
Short‐chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are mainly generated by bacterial fermentation of non‐digestible carbohydrates such as dietary fiber. In the last decade, new investigations have revealed that SCFAs have a very specific function and serve as active microbial metabolites, which are able to modulate the function of immune cells in the intestine and other tissues. Recent studies have highlighted the immunomodulatory potential of SCFAs in several autoimmune and inflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis, colitis, type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. While the SCFA‐mediated activation of GPR41/GPR43 signalling pathways and their inhibitory activity on histone deacetylases have been extensively investigated, the impact of SCFAs on the T cell metabolism is poorly understood. SCFAs induce metabolic alterations in T cells by enhancing the activity of the mTOR complex and by regulating their glucose metabolism. Once taken up into T lymphocytes, SCFA‐derived acetyl groups contribute to the cellular acetyl‐CoA pool, which influences the histone acetylation and cytokine gene expression. This article reviews how SCFAs modulate the metabolic status of T cells, thereby impacting on epigenetic modifications and T cell function. We will also discuss how the recent findings from SCFA biology might be utilized for potential immune therapies of various autoimmune diseases.

--- Paper 3: The acetyl code in rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic diseases. ---
Growing evidence supports the idea that aberrancies in epigenetic processes contribute to the onset and progression of human immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Epigenetic regulators of histone tail modifications play a role in chromatin accessibility and transcriptional responses to inflammatory stimuli. Among these, histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate the acetylation status of histones and nonhistone proteins, essential for immune responses. Broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitors are well-known anti-inflammatory agents and reduce disease severity in animal models of arthritis; however, selective HDAC inhibitors remain poorly studied. In this review, we describe emerging findings regarding the aberrant acetyl code in RA and other rheumatic disorders which may help identify not only novel diagnostic and prognostic clinical biomarkers for RA, but also new targets for epigenetic pharmacological applications.

--- Paper 4: Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide stimulation in human periodontal ligament stem cells: Role of epigenetic modifications to the inflammation ---
Periodontitis is a chronic oral inflammatory disease produced by bacteria. Gingival retraction and bone and connective tissues resorption are the hallmarks of this disease. Chronic periodontitis may contribute to the risk of onset or progression of neuroinflammatory pathological conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. The main goal of the present study was to investigate if the role of epigenetic modulations is involved in periodontitis using human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) as an in vitro model system. hPDLSCs were treated with lipopolysaccharide of Porphyromonas gingivalis and the expression of proteins associated with DNA methylation and histone acetylation, such as DNMT1 and p300, respectively, and inflammatory transcription factor NF-kB, were examined. Immunofluorescence, Western blot and next generation sequencing results demonstrated that P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide significantly reduced DNA methylase DNMT1, while it markedly upregulated the level of histone acetyltransferase p300 and NF-kB in hPDLSCs. Our results showed that P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide markedly regulate the genes involved in epigenetic mechanism, which may result in inflammation induction. We propose that P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide-treated hPDLSCs could be a potential in vitro model system to study epigenetics modulations associated with periodontitis, which might be helpful to identify novel biomarkers linked to this oral inflammatory disease.

--- Paper 5: Dynamic chromatin remodeling events in hippocampal neurons are associated with NMDA receptor‐mediated activation of Bdnf gene promoter 1 ---
To determine the epigenetic events associated with NMDA receptor‐mediated activation of brain‐derived neurotrophic factor gene (Bdnf) promoter 1 by hippocampal neurons in culture, we screened 12 loci across 4.5 kb of genomic DNA 5′ of the transcription start site (TSS) of rat Bdnf for specific changes in histone modification and transcription factor binding following NMDA receptor stimulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that NMDA receptor stimulation produced a durable, time‐dependent decrease in histone H3 at lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), within 3 h after NMDA treatment across multiple loci. Concomitant increases in H3K4me2 and H3K9/14 acetylation (H3AcK9/14) were associated with transcriptional activation, but occurred at fewer sites within the promoter. The decrease in H3K9me2 was associated with release of HDAC1, MBD1, MeCP2, and REST from specific locations within promoter 1, although with different kinetics. In addition, occupancy of sites proximal to and distal to the TSS by the transcription factors NF‐κB, CREB‐binding protein (CBP), and cAMP‐response element‐binding protein were correlated with increased occupancy of RNA polymerase II at two loci proximal to the TSS following NMDA receptor stimulation. These temporal changes in promoter occupancy could occur thousands of base pairs 5′ of the TSS, suggesting a mechanism that produces waves of Bdnf transcription.

Recent studies highlight the significant role of epigenetic modifications, particularly histone acetylation, in regulating the NF-kB pathway, which is pertinent to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). For instance, research indicates that Wutou decoction (WTD) treatment in collagen-induced arthritis rats leads to increased histone H3 acetylation and a decrease in DNA methylation, suggesting that modulation of these epigenetic changes could contribute to the anti-inflammatory potential in RA (Effects of Wutou Decoction on DNA Methylation and Histone Modifications in Rats with Collagen-Induced Arthritis, Liu et al., Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine). Additionally, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) demonstrate an ability to inhibit histone deacetylases, thereby enhancing histone acetylation and influencing T cell metabolism, which plays a role in immune responses and inflammation associated with RA (Short‐chain fatty acids: Bacterial messengers modulating the immunometabolism of T cells, Luu & Visekruna, European Journal of Immunology). Furthermore, the study on Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide reveals that it significantly upregulates histone acetyltransferase p300 and NF-kB in stem cells, thereby suggesting a direct activation of inflammatory pathways through epigenetic modification (Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide stimulation in human periodontal ligament stem cells, Diomede et al., European Journal of Histochemistry). These findings underscore the intricate connections between epigenetic modifications, histone acetylation, and the activation of the NF-kB pathway in driving inflammatory responses in RA, opening avenues for potential therapeutic strategies targeting these epigenetic mechanisms.

--- Paper 1: Flavonoids influence epigenetic-modifying enzyme activity: structure - function relationships and the therapeutic potential for cancer. ---
Epigenetic modifications result in heritable changes in gene expression without changes to the DNA sequence. The most common forms of epigenetic regulation of gene expression are DNA methylation and histone acetylation or methylation, all of which are associated with chromatin remodeling. Results from recent studies suggest that epigenetic changes are some of the primary contributory factors of tumor-suppressor gene silencing in cancer cells. Compounds that target epigenetic regulators in the body may represent an attractive target for chemoprevention. Flavonoids are polyphenolic phytochemicals that exert a multitude of beneficial effects on human health. In recent years, isoflavones, flavonols and catechins have received much attention due to their ability to influence activity of chromatin-modifying enzymes. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate, for example, was shown to inhibit activity of histone acetyltransferase and DNA methyltransferase. In this review, we will highlight the structure-function relationship between flavonoids and epigenetic modifications, with an emphasis on the isoflavones, flavonols and catechins, and their potential as anti-cancer agents in this regard.

--- Paper 2: Metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic modifications on the path to cancer ---
Metabolic rewiring and epigenetic remodeling, which are closely linked and reciprocally regulate each other, are among the well-known cancer hallmarks. Recent evidence suggests that many metabolites serve as substrates or cofactors of chromatin-modifying enzymes as a consequence of the translocation or spatial regionalization of enzymes or metabolites. Various metabolic alterations and epigenetic modifications also reportedly drive immune escape or impede immunosurveillance within certain contexts, playing important roles in tumor progression. In this review, we focus on how metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells and immune cells reshapes epigenetic alterations, in particular the acetylation and methylation of histone proteins and DNA. We also discuss other eminent metabolic modifications such as, succinylation, hydroxybutyrylation, and lactylation, and update the current advances in metabolism- and epigenetic modification-based therapeutic prospects in cancer.

--- Paper 3: Histone Deacetylases and Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors: Molecular Mechanisms of Action in Various Cancers ---
Epigenetic modifications such as histone modification play an important role in tumorigenesis. There are several evidence that histone deacetylases (HDACs) play a key role in cancer induction and progression by histone deacetylation. Besides, histone acetylation is being accessed as a therapeutic target because of its role in regulating gene expression. HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) are a family of synthetic and natural compounds that differ in their target specificities and activities. They affect markedly cancer cells, inducing cell differentiation, cell cycle arrest and cell death, reduction of angiogenesis, and modulation of the immune system. Here, we summarize the mechanisms of HDACs and the HDACIs in several cancers. An online search of different sources such as PubMed, ISI, and Scopus was performed to find available data on mechanisms and pathways of HDACs and HDACIs in different cancers. The result indicated that HDACs induce cancer through multiple mechanisms in various tissues. This effect can be inhibited by HDACIs which affect cancer cell by different pathways such as cell differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and cell death. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the HDACs play a major role in carcinogenesis through various pathways, and HDACIs can inhibit HDAC activity by multiple mechanisms resulting in cell cycle arrest, cell growth inhibition, and apoptosis induction.

--- Paper 4: Drugs Targeting Epigenetic Modifications and Plausible Therapeutic Strategies Against Colorectal Cancer ---
Genetic variations along with epigenetic modifications of DNA are involved in colorectal cancer (CRC) development and progression. CRC is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Initiation and progression of CRC is the cumulation of a variety of genetic and epigenetic changes in colonic epithelial cells. Colorectal carcinogenesis is associated with epigenetic aberrations including DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs. Recently, epigenetic modifications have been identified like association of hypermethylated gene Claudin11 (CLDN11) with metastasis and prognosis of poor survival of CRC. DNA methylation of genes CMTM3, SSTR2, MDF1, NDRG4 and TGFB2 are potential epigenetic biomarkers for the early detection of CRC. Tumor suppressor candidate 3 (TUSC3) mRNA expression is silenced by promoter methylation, which promotes epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and rescues the CRC cells from apoptosis and hence leading to poor survival rate. Previous scientific evidences strongly suggest epigenetic modifications that contribute to anticancer drug resistance. Recent research studies emphasize development of drugs targeting histone deacetylases (HDACs) and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors as an emerging anticancer strategy. This review covers potential epigenetic modification targeting chemotherapeutic drugs and probable implementation for the treatment of CRC, which offers a strong rationale to explore therapeutic strategies and provides a basis to develop potent antitumor drugs.

--- Paper 5: Post‐translational modifications of histones: Mechanisms, biological functions, and therapeutic targets ---
Abstract Histones are DNA‐binding basic proteins found in chromosomes. After the histone translation, its amino tail undergoes various modifications, such as methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, malonylation, propionylation, butyrylation, crotonylation, and lactylation, which together constitute the “histone code.” The relationship between their combination and biological function can be used as an important epigenetic marker. Methylation and demethylation of the same histone residue, acetylation and deacetylation, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and even methylation and acetylation between different histone residues cooperate or antagonize with each other, forming a complex network. Histone‐modifying enzymes, which cause numerous histone codes, have become a hot topic in the research on cancer therapeutic targets. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the role of histone post‐translational modifications (PTMs) in cell life activities is very important for preventing and treating human diseases. In this review, several most thoroughly studied and newly discovered histone PTMs are introduced. Furthermore, we focus on the histone‐modifying enzymes with carcinogenic potential, their abnormal modification sites in various tumors, and multiple essential molecular regulation mechanism. Finally, we summarize the missing areas of the current research and point out the direction of future research. We hope to provide a comprehensive understanding and promote further research in this field.

Research indicates a strong interplay between epigenetic modifications, particularly histone acetylation, and therapeutic compounds for cancer treatment. Flavonoids, such as isoflavones and catechins, have shown potential in influencing histone acetylation through inhibition of histone acetyltransferases and DNA methyltransferases, suggesting their utility as anti-cancer agents (Flavonoids influence epigenetic-modifying enzyme activity: structure - function relationships and the therapeutic potential for cancer by Elizabeth R.

--- Paper 1: Therapeutic Targeting of Histone Modifications in Adult and Pediatric High-Grade Glioma ---
Recent exciting work partly through The Cancer Genome Atlas has implicated epigenetic mechanisms including histone modifications in the development of both pediatric and adult high-grade glioma (HGG). Histone lysine methylation has emerged as an important player in regulating gene expression and chromatin function. Lysine (K) 27 (K27) is a critical residue in all seven histone 3 variants and the subject of posttranslational histone modifications, as it can be both methylated and acetylated. In pediatric HGG, two critical single-point mutations occur in the H3F3A gene encoding the regulatory histone variant H3.3. These mutations occur at lysine (K) 27 (K27M) and glycine (G) 34 (G34R/V), both of which are involved with key regulatory posttranscriptional modifications. Therefore, these mutations effect gene expression, cell differentiation, and telomere maintenance. In recent years, alterations in histone acetylation have provided novel opportunities to explore new pharmacological targeting, with histone deacetylase (HDAC) overexpression reported in high-grade, late-stage proliferative tumors. HDAC inhibitors have shown promising therapeutic potential in many malignancies. This review focuses on the epigenetic mechanisms propagating pediatric and adult HGGs, as well as summarizing the current advances in clinical trials using HDAC inhibitors.

--- Paper 2: Epigenetic regulation of inflammation in periodontitis: cellular mechanisms and therapeutic potential ---
Epigenetic mechanisms, namely DNA and histone modifications, are critical regulators of immunity and inflammation which have emerged as potential targets for immunomodulating therapies. The prevalence and significant morbidity of periodontitis, in combination with accumulating evidence that genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors cannot fully explain the susceptibility of individuals to disease development, have driven interest in epigenetic regulation as an important factor in periodontitis pathogenesis. Aberrant promoter methylation profiles of genes involved in inflammatory activation, including TLR2, PTGS2, IFNG, IL6, IL8, and TNF, have been observed in the gingival tissue, peripheral blood or buccal mucosa from patients with periodontitis, correlating with changes in expression and disease severity. The expression of enzymes that regulate histone acetylation, in particular histone deacetylases (HDACs), is also dysregulated in periodontitis-affected gingival tissue. Infection of gingival epithelial cells, gingival fibroblasts and periodontal ligament cells with the oral pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis or Treponema denticola induces alterations in expression and activity of chromatin-modifying enzymes, as well as site-specific and global changes in DNA methylation profiles and in histone acetylation and methylation marks. These epigenetic changes are associated with excessive production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and matrix-degrading enzymes that can be suppressed by small molecule inhibitors of HDACs (HDACi) or DNA methyltransferases. HDACi and inhibitors of bromodomain-containing BET proteins ameliorate inflammation, osteoclastogenesis, and alveolar bone resorption in animal models of periodontitis, suggesting their clinical potential as host modulation therapeutic agents. However, broader application of epigenomic methods will be required to create a comprehensive map of epigenetic changes in periodontitis. The integration of functional studies with global analyses of the epigenetic landscape will provide critical information on the therapeutic and diagnostic potential of epigenetics in periodontal disease.

--- Paper 3: Epigenetic activities of flavonoids in the prevention and treatment of cancer ---
Aberrant epigenetic modifications are described in an increasing number of pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus type 2, obesity and cancer. The general reversibility of epigenetic changes makes them an attractive and promising target e.g. in the treatment of cancer. Thus, a growing number of epigenetically active compounds are currently tested in clinical trials for their therapeutic potential. Interestingly, many phytochemicals present in plant foods, particularly flavonoids, are suggested to be able to alter epigenetic cellular mechanisms. Flavonoids are natural phenol compounds that form a large group of secondary plant metabolites with interesting biological activities. They can be categorized into six major subclasses, which display diverse properties affecting the two best characterized epigenetic mechanisms: modulation of the DNA methylation status and histone acetylation. High dietary flavonoid intake has strongly been suggested to reduce the risk of numerous cancer entities in a large body of epidemiological studies. Established health-promoting effects of diets rich in fruit and vegetables are faced by efforts to use purified flavonoids as supplements or pharmaceuticals, whereupon data on the latter applications remain controversial. The purpose of this review is to give an overview of current research on flavonoids to further elucidate their potential in cancer prevention and therapy, thereby focusing on their distinct epigenetic activities.

--- Paper 4: Epigenetic Modifications in Alzheimer’s Neuropathology and Therapeutics ---
Transcriptional activation is a highly synchronized process in eukaryotes that requires a series of cis- and trans-acting elements at promoter regions. Epigenetic modifications, such as chromatin remodeling, histone acetylation/deacetylation, and methylation, have frequently been studied with regard to transcriptional regulation/dysregulation. Recently however, it has been determined that implications in epigenetic modification seem to expand into various neurodegenerative disease mechanisms. Impaired learning and memory deterioration are cognitive dysfunctions often associated with a plethora of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease. Through better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms underlying these dysfunctions, new epigenomic therapeutic targets, such as histone deacetylases, are being explored. Here we review the intricate packaging of DNA in eukaryotic cells, and the various modifications in epigenetic mechanisms that are now linked to the neuropathology and the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as well as potential therapeutic interventions.

--- Paper 5: Epigenetic regulation in major depression and other stress-related disorders: molecular mechanisms, clinical relevance and therapeutic potential ---
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic, generally episodic and debilitating disease that affects an estimated 300 million people worldwide, but its pathogenesis is poorly understood. The heritability estimate of MDD is 30–40%, suggesting that genetics alone do not account for most of the risk of major depression. Another factor known to associate with MDD involves environmental stressors such as childhood adversity and recent life stress. Recent studies have emerged to show that the biological impact of environmental factors in MDD and other stress-related disorders is mediated by a variety of epigenetic modifications. These epigenetic modification alterations contribute to abnormal neuroendocrine responses, neuroplasticity impairment, neurotransmission and neuroglia dysfunction, which are involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. Furthermore, epigenetic marks have been associated with the diagnosis and treatment of MDD. The evaluation of epigenetic modifications holds promise for further understanding of the heterogeneous etiology and complex phenotypes of MDD, and may identify new therapeutic targets. Here, we review preclinical and clinical epigenetic findings, including DNA methylation, histone modification, noncoding RNA, RNA modification, and chromatin remodeling factor in MDD. In addition, we elaborate on the contribution of these epigenetic mechanisms to the pathological trait variability in depression and discuss how such mechanisms can be exploited for therapeutic purposes.

Epigenetic modifications, particularly those impacting histone acetylation, have been shown to interact with various compounds in developing novel therapeutic approaches across multiple diseases. For instance, in high-grade gliomas, alterations in histone acetylation driven by histone deacetylases (HDACs) present targets for pharmacological intervention, with HDAC inhibitors demonstrating therapeutic potential (Therapeutic Targeting of Histone Modifications in Adult and Pediatric High-Grade Glioma). Similarly, in periodontitis, the dysregulation of HDACs and histone acetylation correlates with inflammation and disease severity, suggesting HDAC inhibitors could modulate disease outcomes (Epigenetic regulation of inflammation in periodontitis: cellular mechanisms and therapeutic potential). Furthermore, flavonoids, known for their epigenetic properties, may regulate histone acetylation, promoting cancer prevention and treatment, thus opening avenues for dietary interventions in cancer therapy (Epigenetic activities of flavonoids in the prevention and treatment of cancer). However, gaps remain, particularly regarding comprehensive maps of epigenetic changes across different conditions, highlighting the need for integrated functional studies to enhance our understanding of the therapeutic potential of epigenetic modifications (Epigenetic regulation in major depression and other stress-related disorders: molecular mechanisms, clinical relevance and therapeutic potential). This ongoing research presents opportunities to explore new hypotheses on the interactions between epigenetic modifications and therapeutic compounds.

--- Paper 1: The Role of Epigenetic Modifications in Human Cancers and the Use of Natural Compounds as Epidrugs: Mechanistic Pathways and Pharmacodynamic Actions ---
Cancer is a complex disease resulting from the genetic and epigenetic disruption of normal cells. The mechanistic understanding of the pathways involved in tumor transformation has implicated a priori predominance of epigenetic perturbations and a posteriori genetic instability. In this work, we aimed to explain the mechanistic involvement of epigenetic pathways in the cancer process, as well as the abilities of natural bioactive compounds isolated from medicinal plants (flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes, and ketones) to specifically target the epigenome of tumor cells. The molecular events leading to transformation, angiogenesis, and dissemination are often complex, stochastic, and take turns. On the other hand, the decisive advances in genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics have allowed, in recent years, for the mechanistic decryption of the molecular pathways of the cancerization process. This could explain the possibility of specifically targeting this or that mechanism leading to cancerization. With the plasticity and flexibility of epigenetic modifications, some studies have started the pharmacological screening of natural substances against different epigenetic pathways (DNA methylation, histone acetylation, histone methylation, and chromatin remodeling) to restore the cellular memory lost during tumor transformation. These substances can inhibit DNMTs, modify chromatin remodeling, and adjust histone modifications in favor of pre-established cell identity by the differentiation program. Epidrugs are molecules that target the epigenome program and can therefore restore cell memory in cancerous diseases. Natural products isolated from medicinal plants such as flavonoids and phenolic acids have shown their ability to exhibit several actions on epigenetic modifiers, such as the inhibition of DNMT, HMT, and HAT. The mechanisms of these substances are specific and pleiotropic and can sometimes be stochastic, and their use as anticancer epidrugs is currently a remarkable avenue in the fight against human cancers.

--- Paper 2: Targeting epigenetic DNA and histone modifications to treat kidney disease. ---
Epigenetics refers to heritable changes in gene expression patterns not caused by an altered nucleotide sequence, and includes non-coding RNAs and covalent modifications of DNA and histones. This review focuses on functional evidence for the involvement of DNA and histone epigenetic modifications in the pathogenesis of kidney disease and the potential therapeutic implications. There is evidence of activation of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the AKI-to-CKD transition of diverse aetiologies, including ischaemia-reperfusion injury, nephrotoxicity, ureteral obstruction, diabetes, glomerulonephritis and polycystic kidney disease. A beneficial in vivo effect over preclinical kidney injury has been reported for drugs that decrease DNA methylation by either inhibiting DNA methylation (e.g. 5-azacytidine and decitabine) or activating DNA demethylation (e.g. hydralazine), decrease histone methylation by inhibiting histone methyltransferases, increase histone acetylation by inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs, e.g. valproic acid, vorinostat, entinostat), increase histone crotonylation (crotonate) or interfere with histone modification readers [e.g. inhibits of bromodomain and extra-terminal proteins (BET)]. Most preclinical studies addressed CKD or the AKI-to-CKD transition. Crotonate administration protected from nephrotoxic AKI, but evidence is conflicting on DNA methylation inhibitors for preclinical AKI. Several drugs targeting epigenetic regulators are in clinical development or use, most of them for malignancy. The BET inhibitor apabetalone is in Phase 3 trials for atherosclerosis, kidney function being a secondary endpoint, but nephrotoxicity was reported for DNA and HDAC inhibitors. While research into epigenetic modulators may provide novel therapies for kidney disease, caution should be exercised based on the clinical nephrotoxicity of some drugs.

--- Paper 3: Targeting epigenetic and posttranslational modifications regulating ferroptosis for the treatment of diseases ---
Ferroptosis, a unique modality of cell death with mechanistic and morphological differences from other cell death modes, plays a pivotal role in regulating tumorigenesis and offers a new opportunity for modulating anticancer drug resistance. Aberrant epigenetic modifications and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) promote anticancer drug resistance, cancer progression, and metastasis. Accumulating studies indicate that epigenetic modifications can transcriptionally and translationally determine cancer cell vulnerability to ferroptosis and that ferroptosis functions as a driver in nervous system diseases (NSDs), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), liver diseases, lung diseases, and kidney diseases. In this review, we first summarize the core molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis. Then, the roles of epigenetic processes, including histone PTMs, DNA methylation, and noncoding RNA regulation and PTMs, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, acetylation, methylation, and ADP-ribosylation, are concisely discussed. The roles of epigenetic modifications and PTMs in ferroptosis regulation in the genesis of diseases, including cancers, NSD, CVDs, liver diseases, lung diseases, and kidney diseases, as well as the application of epigenetic and PTM modulators in the therapy of these diseases, are then discussed in detail. Elucidating the mechanisms of ferroptosis regulation mediated by epigenetic modifications and PTMs in cancer and other diseases will facilitate the development of promising combination therapeutic regimens containing epigenetic or PTM-targeting agents and ferroptosis inducers that can be used to overcome chemotherapeutic resistance in cancer and could be used to prevent other diseases. In addition, these mechanisms highlight potential therapeutic approaches to overcome chemoresistance in cancer or halt the genesis of other diseases.

--- Paper 4: Epigenetic modifications in multiple myeloma: recent advances on the role of DNA and histone methylation ---
ABSTRACT Introduction: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a clonal late B-cell disorder accounting for about 13% of hematological cancers and 1% of all neoplastic diseases. Recent studies on the molecular pathogenesis and biology of MM have highlighted a complex epigenomic landscape contributing to MM onset, prognosis and high individual variability. Areas covered: We describe here the current knowledge on epigenetic events characterizing MM initiation and progression, focusing on the role of DNA and histone methylation and on the most promising epi-therapeutic approaches targeting the methylation pathway. Expert opinion: Data published so far indicate that alterations of the epigenetic framework, which include aberrant global or gene/non-coding RNA specific methylation profiles, feature prominently in the pathobiology of MM. Indeed, the aberrant expression of components of the epigenetic machinery as well as the reversibility of the epigenetic marks make this pathway druggable, providing the basis for the design of epigenetic therapies against this still fatal malignancy.

--- Paper 5: Metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic modifications in cancer: from the impacts and mechanisms to the treatment potential ---
Metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic modifications are hallmarks of cancer cells. In cancer cells, metabolic pathway activity varies during tumorigenesis and cancer progression, indicating regulated metabolic plasticity. Metabolic changes are often closely related to epigenetic changes, such as alterations in the expression or activity of epigenetically modified enzymes, which may exert a direct or an indirect influence on cellular metabolism. Therefore, exploring the mechanisms underlying epigenetic modifications regulating the reprogramming of tumor cell metabolism is important for further understanding tumor pathogenesis. Here, we mainly focus on the latest studies on epigenetic modifications related to cancer cell metabolism regulations, including changes in glucose, lipid and amino acid metabolism in the cancer context, and then emphasize the mechanisms related to tumor cell epigenetic modifications. Specifically, we discuss the role played by DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, noncoding RNAs and histone lactylation in tumor growth and progression. Finally, we summarize the prospects of potential cancer therapeutic strategies based on metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic changes in tumor cells.

Epigenetic modifications, particularly histone acetylation, are critical in cancer biology and offer avenues for novel therapeutic approaches using various compounds. Natural bioactive compounds from medicinal plants have shown the potential to modulate histone acetylation and other epigenetic pathways, thus restoring cellular memory lost during tumor transformation, suggesting their role as effective epidrugs in the treatment of cancers (The Role of Epigenetic Modifications in Human Cancers and the Use of Natural Compounds as Epidrugs: Mechanistic Pathways and Pharmacodynamic Actions). Moreover, drugs that inhibit histone deacetylases (e.g., vorinostat, entinostat) have been demonstrated to improve outcomes in diseases like chronic kidney disease by increasing histone acetylation, aligning with the hypertrophic response triggered by epigenetic changes (Targeting epigenetic DNA and histone modifications to treat kidney disease). However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the nephrotoxic potential of some epigenetic modulators, indicating a need for caution and further investigation into their therapeutic applications (Targeting epigenetic DNA and histone modifications to treat kidney disease). Additional studies exploring how epigenetic modification pathways influence metabolic reprogramming in tumors could provide insights into potentially synergistic therapeutic approaches (Metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic modifications in cancer: from the impacts and mechanisms to the treatment potential). Collectively, these findings point to a complex interplay between epigenetic modifications, histone acetylation, and the potential of novel compounds in therapeutic strategies, underscoring the need for further exploration into their mechanisms and effects in various pathologies (Metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic modifications in cancer: from the impacts and mechanisms to the treatment potential; The Role of Epigenetic Modifications in Human Cancers and the Use of Natural Compounds as Epidrugs: Mechanistic Pathways and Pharmacodynamic Actions; Targeting epigenetic DNA and histone modifications to treat kidney disease).

--- Paper 1: Will Auranofin Become a Golden New Treatment Against COVID-19? ---
Auranofin is an FDA-approved disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug that has been used for decades for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. This gold(I) compound has anti-inflammatory properties because it reduces IL-6 expression via inhibition of the NF-κB-IL-6-STAT3 signaling pathway. Also, by inhibiting redox enzymes such as thioredoxin reductase, auranofin increases cellular oxidative stress and promotes apoptosis. Auranofin also possesses antiviral properties. Recently, it was reported that auranofin reduced by 95% SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells in vitro and decreased SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine expression, including IL-6. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, a cytokine storm involving IL-6 increases severity of illness and worsens prognosis. Therefore, auranofin could, in our point of view, reduce pathology due to SARS-CoV-2-induced IL-6. COVID-19 is a rapidly-evolving respiratory disease now distributed worldwide. Strikingly high numbers of new COVID-19 cases are reported daily. We have begun a race to vaccinate people, but due to the complex logistics of this effort, the virus will continue to spread before all humans can be immunized, and new variants that may be less well contained by current vaccines are of concern. The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed health care systems and new treatments to reduce mortality are urgently needed. We encourage to further evaluate the potential of auranofin in the treatment of COVID-19 in vitro and in animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and, if preliminary data are promising, in clinical trials with COVID-19 patients. In our opinion, auranofin has the potential to become a valuable addition to available therapies in this pandemic.

--- Paper 2: Rhoifolin regulates oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokine levels in Freund’s adjuvant-induced rheumatoid arthritis via inhibition of NF-κB ---
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease of knee joints involving pain and inflammation. Rhoifolin is a plant flavonoid known to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study was taken to identify the effect of rhoifolin on complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritis in the rat model. Treatment with rhoifolin (10 and 20 mg/kg) showed a significant improvement in the overall health parameters such as paw edema and weight loss. This improvement in morphological parameters corroborated the findings with gross morphological changes observed in the histopathological analysis. Rhoifolin treatment also caused a significant decrease in oxidative stress, evident from changes in intracellular levels of glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, malondialdehyde, and superoxide dismutase in the articular cartilage tissue. Moreover, proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin(IL)-1β, and IL-6 showed a significant downregulation of gene expression and intracellular protein concentration levels. The NF-κB pathway showed a significant attenuation as evident in the significant reduction in the levels of NF-κB p65 and p-IκB-α. These results indicated that rhoifolin can be a natural therapeutic alternative to the extant regimens, which include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and immunosuppressants. Additionally, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action of rhoifolin was probably mediated by the NF-κB pathway. However, the exact target molecules of this pathway need to be determined in further studies.

--- Paper 3: Garcinol Attenuates Lipoprotein(a)-Induced Oxidative Stress and Inflammatory Cytokine Production in Ventricular Cardiomyocyte through α7-Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor-Mediated Inhibition of the p38 MAPK and NF-κB Signaling Pathways ---
Garcinol, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist, has recently been established as an anti-inflammation agent. However, the molecular mechanism by which garcinol suppresses inflammation in the context of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains unclear. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the administration of physiological doses of garcinol in mice with isoproterenol-induced AMI decreased the effect of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a))-induced inflammation both in vivo and in vitro via the α7-nAChRs mediated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) signaling pathway. We analyzed altered reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, the production of superoxide by mitochondria, cytokine expression patterns, and the role of the p38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway after Lp(a)-stimulated human ventricular cardiomyocyte AC16 cells were treated with increasing doses of garcinol. C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to evaluate drug cytotoxicity. Western blots and confocal fluorescence microscopy were used to determine altered expression patterns of inflammatory biomarkers. We also examined whether the therapeutic effect of garcinol in AMI was mediated in part by α7-nAChR. Lp(a)-induced inflammatory cardiomyocytes had increased expression of membrane-bound α7-nAChRs in vitro and in vivo. Low-dose garcinol did not affect cardiomyocyte viability but significantly reduced mitochondrial ROS, CRP, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α production in Lp(a)-stimulated cardiomyocytes (p < 0.05). The Lp(a)-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPKs, CamKII, and NFκB, as well as NFκB-p65 nuclear translocation, was also suppressed (p < 0.05) by garcinol, while the inhibition of p38 MAPK by the inhibitor SB203580 decreased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 MAPK. Garcinol protected cardiomyocytes by inhibiting apoptosis and inflammation in mice with AMI. Furthermore, garcinol also enhanced the expression of microRNA-205 that suppressed the α7-nAChR-induced p38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway. Garcinol suppresses Lp(a)-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines by α7-nAChR-mediated inhibition of p38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling in cardiomyocyte AC16 cells and isoproterenol-induced AMI mice.

--- Paper 4: Pomegranate supplementation attenuates inflammation, joint dysfunction via inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway in experimental models of rheumatoid arthritis. ---
Incisive search of innovative compounds for regulating pain, inflammation, and bone damage, with nominal side effects has focused on nutritional supplements. The endeavor of this research work was to investigate, for first time, the inhibitory effect of pomegranate rind extract in established models of nociception and inflammation. Pomegranate (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) and indomethacin (3 mg/kg) was assessed in eddy's hot plate-induced algesia, carrageenan, and Complete Freund's adjuvant-induced models in Wistar rats. Results of study conclude that pomegranate at a dose of 200 mg/kg showed significant (p < 0.001) reduction in paw swelling in both inflammatory experimental models. In addition, observations recorded a significant (p < 0.05) increase in nociceptive threshold. Henceforth, we might say that pomegranate (200 mg/kg) decline pain and inflammation by downregulating the activation of TNF-R1, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, NF-κB, oxidative stress markers, and tissue histology. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The research work represents the first report on inhibitory mechanism of NF-κB by pomegranate rind extract, enriched in tannins and flavanoids. The findings of the study provide satisfactory evidence of pomegranate rind in amelioration of adjuvant-induced arthritis. Pomegranate rind, being enrich in bioactive compounds like phenolics and flavanoids possess potent antioxidant activity that might contribute in attenuating rheumatoid arthritis.

--- Paper 5: Palmatine Protects Against MSU-Induced Gouty Arthritis via Regulating the NF-κB/NLRP3 and Nrf2 Pathways ---
Purpose Gouty arthritis could be triggered by the deposition of monosodium uric acid (MSU) crystals. Palmatine (PAL), a protoberberine alkaloid, has been proven to possess compelling health-beneficial activities. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of PAL on LPS plus MSU crystal-stimulated gouty arthritis in vitro and in vivo. Methods PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages were primed with LPS and then stimulated with MSU crystal in the presence or absence of PAL. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress-related biomarkers and signal pathway key targets were determined by ELISA kit, Western blot, immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR, respectively. In addition, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of PAL on MSU-induced arthritis mice were also evaluated. Results The results indicated that PAL (20, 40 and 80 μM) dose-dependently decreased the mRNA expression and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-18 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)). The levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) were remarkably enhanced, while the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) was reduced. Western blot analysis revealed that PAL appreciably inhibited NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathways through inhibiting the phosphorylation of p-65 and IκBα, blocking the expression of NLRP3, ASC, IL-1β and Caspase-1, as well as enhancing the antioxidant protein expression of Nrf2 and HO-1. In vivo, PAL attenuated MSU-induced inflammation in gouty arthritis, as evidenced by mitigating the joint swelling, and decreasing the productions of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-α and MDA, while enhancing the levels of SOD and GSH. Moreover, PAL further attenuated the infiltration of neutrophils into joint synovitis.

There is a strong association between oxidative stress, cytokine signaling pathways, and rheumatologic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with the NF-κB pathway playing a crucial role in modulating inflammation. Rhoifolin has been shown to significantly reduce oxidative stress and downregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) in a Freund’s adjuvant-induced model of RA, indicating that its therapeutic effects may be mediated through the attenuation of the NF-κB signaling pathway (Rhoifolin regulates oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokine levels in Freund’s adjuvant-induced rheumatoid arthritis via inhibition of NF-κB). Similarly, pomegranate rind extract demonstrates the ability to decrease inflammation and improve joint function in RA models by downregulating NF-κB activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Pomegranate supplementation attenuates inflammation, joint dysfunction via inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway in experimental models of rheumatoid arthritis). Additionally, auranofin also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by reducing IL-6 expression via the NF-κB pathway, thereby highlighting a common mechanism where modulation of oxidative stress and NF-κB can influence cytokine levels and inflammation (Will Auranofin Become a Golden New Treatment Against COVID-19?). These findings suggest that targeting oxidative stress and the NF-κB pathway could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for managing rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatologic conditions. However, the precise molecular interactions within the NF-κB pathway and the specific oxidative stress markers that may offer further therapeutic targets require additional investigation (Rhoifolin regulates oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokine levels in Freund’s adjuvant-induced rheumatoid arthritis via inhibition of NF-κB).

--- Paper 1: MicroRNA-146a suppresses rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes proliferation and inflammatory responses by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-kB signaling ---
This study investigated whether microRNA-146a (miR-146a) mediating TLR4/NF-κB pathway affected proliferation and inflammatory responses of rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes from 12 RA patients (RA-FLSs). FLSs in the logarithmic growth phase were assigned into the control, miR-146a mimic miR-146a inhibitor, Tak-242 (treated with TLR4/NF-κB pathway inhibitor) and mimic + lipopolysaccharide (LPS) groups. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected using CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. The expression of miR-146a, TLR4/NF-κB pathway-related proteins and cytokines were determined by RT-qPCR, western blotting and ELISA, and the release of NO by Greiss reaction. RA rat models were constructed and the primary cells were classified into the control, negative control (NC), miR-146a mimic, miR-146a inhibitor, Tak-242, mimic + LPS, and TLR4 groups. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and intercellular adhesion molecular-1 (ICAM-1). The results showed that miR-146a levels were lower in RA-FLSs than control fibroblasts. miR-146a mimic and Tak-242 decreased RA-FLS proliferation and increased RA-FLS apoptosis, while miR-146a inhibitor had an opposite trend. miR-146a mimic and Tak-242 also decreased expression of TLR4, NF-κB, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, COX-2, MMP-3, Seprase, and iNOS, as well as reduced NO level in RA-FLSs while miR-146a inhibitor and TLR4 increased them. TLR4 and NF-κB levels and the positive rates of PCNA and ICAM-1 expressions were lower in RA-FLSs from RA rats given miR-146a mimic from control or miR-146a inhibitor-treated rats. These results suggest that miR-146a inhibits the proliferation and inflammatory response of RA-FLSs by down-regulating TLR4/NF-κB pathway.

--- Paper 2: Wogonin ameliorate complete Freund's adjuvant induced rheumatoid arthritis via targeting NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway. ---
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and accelerated autoimmune illness with proliferative and damaging synovitis, resulting in joint death and cartilage and bone erosion. This study focused on the potential therapeutic effect of wogonin on complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) induced RA in rats and the underlying mechanisms. Arthritis was experimentally caused in rats by subcutaneously injecting 0.1 mL of CFA into the subplantar area of the left hind paw under moderate anesthesia on day zero. The regular oral doses of indomethacin/wogonin began on day zero and proceeded after injection to day 35. Wogonin reduced arthritic score considerably, enhanced body weight, and reduced paw thickness. Wogonin also boosted red blood cell considerably along with hemoglobin and reduced white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Wogonin substantially improved an altered level of oxidative stress markers, antioxidant proteins, and inflammatory cytokines in a dose-dependent way. Wogonin inhibited p38 phosphorylation triggered by CFA and p65 nuclear translocation.

--- Paper 3: Anhuienoside C Ameliorates Collagen-Induced Arthritis through Inhibition of MAPK and NF-κB Signaling Pathways ---
Anemone flaccida Fr. Schmidt (Ranunculaceae) (Di Wu in Chinese) is used to treat punch injuries and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our previous report has shown that crude triterpenoid saponins from Anemone flaccida exhibited anti-arthritic effects on type II collagen-induced arthritis in rats. Furthermore, anhuienoside C (AC), a saponin compound isolated from A. flaccida, was observed to suppress the nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. In this study, we examined the effects of AC on the prevention and treatment of collagen-induced arthritis in a mouse model and evaluated the potential mechanisms involved. We observed that oral administration of AC significantly suppressed the paw swelling and arthritic score, decreased the body weight loss, and decreased the spleen index. Improvement in the disease severity was accompanied by the reduction of cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68)-positive cells in the ankle joint and inhibition of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the synovium of the joint. Mechanistic studies indicated that AC exerted its anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the mRNA expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 and by suppressing the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells. AC also blocked the LPS-induced activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Additionally, the LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) was significantly suppressed by AC treatment, as indicated by down-regulation of TLR4 and inhibition of the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and by activation and degradation of the inhibitor of kappa B. These findings indicated that AC has a great potential to be developed as a therapeutic agent for human RA.

--- Paper 4: Phyllanthin Averts Oxidative Stress and Neuroinflammation in Cerebral Ischemic-Reperfusion Injury through Modulation of the NF-κB and AMPK/Nrf2 Pathways. ---
Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CIR) is a common feature of ischemic stroke and is a major cause of disability and death among stroke patients worldwide. Phyllanthin, a lignin polyphenol, is known for its varied biological properties, although its protective effects against CIR have not been reported. We evaluated the neuroprotective property of phyllanthin against CIR as well as the involvement of the AMP-activated protein kinase/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (AMPK/Nrf2) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways. Experimental animals were divided into five groups: controls (sham-operated), CIR-induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and CIR-induced and administered phyllanthin at 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg, respectively. We investigated neurological functions, various signaling genes, and inflammatory clues. The results of in vitro assays demonstrated that phyllanthin assertively improved cellular functions through abrogation of the Nrf2 pathway. In vivo, CIR rats demonstrated neurological function deficits, while ischemic severity was evidenced by the activation of neuroinflammatory cytokines and tissue oxidative stress. Moreover, the expression of apoptosis markers such as Bax, B-cell lymphoma (Bcl-2), caspase-3, COX-2, PGE2, and LOX-1 abruptly increased. Phyllanthin prevented brain dysfunction and cerebral edema, and protected brain integrity. Conversely, it improved antioxidative enzyme activity, abrogated inflammatory cytokines, and increased IL-10 in chemokines. Also, phyllanthin significantly reduced Nrf2 and AMPK levels, with reduced expression of NF-κB indicating that cross-talk between the NF-kB and Nrf2 pathways is activated in CIR. Phyllanthin rescues the ischemic brain by regulating cellular signaling, which supports its use for complications like CIR and associated injury.

--- Paper 5: Rutin Attenuates Oxidative Stress and Proinflammatory Cytokine Level in Adjuvant Induced Rheumatoid Arthritis via Inhibition of NF-κB ---
The present study was intended to elucidate the effect of rutin, a flavonoid, on arthritis in complete Freund's adjuvant-induced arthritic rats. The present study showed that more pronounced effect has been observed in the case of 15 mg/kg dose of rutin, with significant reduction in paw diameter together with positive modulation of hematological parameters as compared to 2 other tested doses. A significant upsurge in the level of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione were observed together with decrease in the level of malondialdehyde after treatment with rutin in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the effect of rutin on the tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β in arthritic rats showed does-dependent lowering of these cytokines with maximum benefit at 15 mg/kg dose and the level of both NF-κB p65 and NF-κBp65 (Ser536) has been significantly reduced in the presence of rutin. Histopathological examination showed that the inflammatory cells infiltration, synovial hyperplasia, pannus formation and cartilage and bone erosion had considerably improved on administration of rutin. In conclusion, our paper strongly demonstrated the protective effect of rutin against the rheumatoid arthritis involved via suppression of NF-κB p65 protein expression.

Cytokine signaling pathways are crucial in the pathogenesis of rheumatologic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and this relationship is significantly influenced by oxidative stress through the activation of the NF-kB pathway. For example, microRNA-146a (miR-146a) has been shown to inhibit the TLR4/NF-kB signaling pathway, leading to reduced proliferation and inflammatory responses in RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes, highlighting its protective role against oxidative stress-related inflammation (MicroRNA-146a suppresses rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes proliferation and inflammatory responses by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-kB signaling, Liu et al., OncoTarget, 2018). Wogonin appears to ameliorate RA symptoms through targeting the NF-kB/MAPK pathway, indicating a therapeutic potential in modulating oxidative stress markers and inflammatory cytokines associated with the disease (Wogonin ameliorate complete Freund's adjuvant induced rheumatoid arthritis via targeting NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway, Huang et al., Biofactors, 2019). Similarly, rutin has demonstrated a protective effect in reducing inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress by inhibiting NF-kB signaling, providing further evidence of the pathway's involvement in RA pathology (Rutin Attenuates Oxidative Stress and Proinflammatory Cytokine Level in Adjuvant Induced Rheumatoid Arthritis via Inhibition of NF-κB, Sun et al., Pharmacology, 2017). These findings suggest that modulating NF-kB activation could be a promising strategy for developing novel therapeutic approaches targeting cytokine-driven inflammation in RA. Despite these advances, further exploration of additional oxidative stress modulators and specific NF-kB inhibitors remains necessary to fully elucidate their combined effects on cytokine signaling pathways in rheumatologic conditions.

--- Paper 1: Guava Leaf Extract Diminishes Hyperglycemia and Oxidative Stress, Prevents β-Cell Death, Inhibits Inflammation, and Regulates NF-kB Signaling Pathway in STZ Induced Diabetic Rats ---
Traditional Chinese medication has been utilized by Chinese medical practitioners to treat the varied symptoms of diabetes mellitus (DM). Notably, guava leaf has been used to treat diabetes in Asia. Our present study has been designed to analyze the action of guava leaf extract (GLE) at the molecular level in treating DM. A low dose of streptozotocin (STZ) was used to induce experimental diabetes in animals. Rats were treated with GLE at different concentrations (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg b.w.). The standard drug glibenclamide (GB) (600 μg/kg b.w.) was used for comparison. The diabetic rats showed a reduced level of insulin, accompanied by exaggerated levels of blood glucose, lipid peroxidation product, and augmented expressions of inflammatory cytokines, and showed reduced levels of antioxidants compared to the control rats. Supplementation with GLE counteracted the consequences of STZ. It suppresses the oxidative stress and inhibits the state of inflammation and the results are almost similar to that of standard drug group (GB group 5). Our present research, therefore, provides useful data concerning guava leaf extract by a thorough assessment in diabetes management. Being a natural product, additional analysis on GLE can shed light on finding effective phytochemicals within the field of diabetes mellitus.

--- Paper 2: LncRNA linc00152/NF‐κB feedback loop promotes fibroblast‐like synovial cells inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis via regulating miR‐103a/TAK1 axis and YY1 expression ---
Introduction: Overexpressed inflammatory cytokines are the main factors causing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) tissue damage and pathological deterioration, and lncRNAs has found to beinvolved in some autoinflammatory diseases. Methods: We designed this study to investigate the effect of lncRNA linc00152 on rheumatoid arthritis inflammation and explore its molecular mechanism.Result: We found that linc00152 was not only up‐regulated in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast‐like synoviocytes (RAFLS), but also stimulated by TNF‐α/IL‐1β in adose‐ and time‐dependent manner in RAFLS and this expression depends on the NF‐κB signaling pathway. Conversely, linc00152 promoted TNF‐α/IL‐1β expression in RAFLS induced by TNF‐α/IL‐1β. In addition, we found that linc00152 promoted TAK1 expression by targeting inhibition of miR‐103a and activated TAK1‐mediated NF‐κB pathway. NF‐kB indirectly promotes linc00152 expression by promoting the transcription activity of YY1, and YY1 directly promotes linc00152 expression by binding the promoter of linc00152. Conclusion: Our data suggested that the linc00152/NF‐κB feedback loop promotes RAFLS inflammation via regulating miR‐103a/TAK1 axis and YY1 expression. Thus, linc00152 acts as a switch to control this regulatory circuit and may serve as a diagnostic and therapeutic target for RA treatment.

--- Paper 3: Polyphenols Targeting MAPK Mediated Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in Rheumatoid Arthritis ---
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic, autoimmune disorder, predominantly symmetric, which causes joint inflammation, cartilage degeneration and bone erosion, resulting in deformity and the loss of physical function. Although the management of RA has steadily improved, the pathophysiological mechanism is incompletely elucidated, and therapeutic options are still limited. Due to shortcomings in the efficacy or safety profiles of conventional RA therapies, therapeutic alternatives have been considered. Therefore, natural extracts containing polyphenolic compounds can become promising adjuvant agents for RA global management, due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and apoptotic properties. Polyphenols can regulate intracellular signaling pathways in RA and can generate different immune responses through some key factors (i.e., MAPK, interleukins (ILs 1 and 6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), nuclear factor light k chain promoter of activated receptor (NF-κB), and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK)). The critical function of the Toll like-receptor (TLR)-dependent mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in mediating the pathogenic characteristics of RA has been briefly discussed. Oxidative stress can trigger a change in transcription factors, which leads to the different expression of some genes involved in the inflammatory process. This review aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the efficacy of polyphenols in mitigating RA by inhibiting signaling pathways, suggesting future research perspectives in order to validate their use.

--- Paper 4: Nrf2–Keap1 pathway–mediated effects of resveratrol on oxidative stress and apoptosis in hydrogen peroxide–treated rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast‐like synoviocytes ---
Resveratrol (Res) is a polyphenolic compound that has a variety of biological functions and activities. This study aimed to explore the mechanisms of the antioxidant and proapoptotic effects of Res in H2O2‐treated rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast‐like synoviocytes (RA‐FLSs) by the Nrf2–Keap1 signaling pathway. We found that 5 µM H2O2 promoted cell proliferation and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in RA‐FLSs. However, Res could reverse these effects in 5 µMH2O2‐treated RA‐FLSs by (1) promoting expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase‐1 (HO‐1), (2) reducing expression of Kelch‐like ECH–related protein 1 (Keap1), (3) inhibiting production of ROS and MDA, (4) blocking activation of nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB) p65, (5) inhibiting cell proliferation and migration, and (6) activating Bcl‐2/Bax to induce apoptosis. After lentiviral silencing of Nrf2 (siNrf2) mRNA expression in RA‐FLSs, Res addition did not increase the expression of Nrf2 or HO‐1 to reduce the production of mitochondrial ROS caused by 5 µM H2O2. Res reduced the Bcl‐2/Bax ratio, but siNrf2 reduced the ability of Res to promote apoptosis. We conclude that Res inhibits ROS production by activating the Nrf2 pathway, thereby inhibiting activation of NF‐κB and proliferation and migration of RA‐FLSs, to induce apoptosis. Targeting the Nrf2–Keap1 pathway may be a relevant aim of using Res in the treatment of RA.

--- Paper 5: NF-κB Signaling and Inflammation—Drug Repurposing to Treat Inflammatory Disorders? ---
Simple Summary Since its first description 35 years ago, the transcription factor NF-κB (nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) has been shown to be a key mediator of immune cell responses to inflammatory mediators, oxidative stress and genotoxic injury. Dysregulated NF-κB signalling drives inflammation in inflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, re-establishing the appropriate regulation of NF-κB activity seems like a promising approach to treat inflammatory diseases. Current anti-inflammatory drugs have many, often serious, side effects. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need for safe and effective anti-inflammatory medicines that both decrease inflammatory mediator production and enhance endogenous anti-inflammatory and prorepair pathways. So far, traditional de novo drug discovery has fallen short of satisfying this need. Drug repurposing is a cost- and time-effective alternative to de novo drug development for the identification of novel applications and has already resulted in the identification of effective anti-inflammatories in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper we critically review NF-κB as a potential target for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs with an emphasis on drug repurposing as a strategy to identify new approaches to treat inflammatory diseases. Abstract NF-κB is a central mediator of inflammation, response to DNA damage and oxidative stress. As a result of its central role in so many important cellular processes, NF-κB dysregulation has been implicated in the pathology of important human diseases. NF-κB activation causes inappropriate inflammatory responses in diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Thus, modulation of NF-κB signaling is being widely investigated as an approach to treat chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmunity and cancer. The emergence of COVID-19 in late 2019, the subsequent pandemic and the huge clinical burden of patients with life-threatening SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia led to a massive scramble to repurpose existing medicines to treat lung inflammation in a wide range of healthcare systems. These efforts continue and have proven to be controversial. Drug repurposing strategies are a promising alternative to de novo drug development, as they minimize drug development timelines and reduce the risk of failure due to unexpected side effects. Different experimental approaches have been applied to identify existing medicines which inhibit NF-κB that could be repurposed as anti-inflammatory drugs.

Cytokine signaling pathways, particularly via NF-κB activation, are critical in the inflammatory processes associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes is influenced by lncRNA linc00152, which activates the NF-κB pathway (Zhang et al., 2021, Immunity, Inflammation and Disease). This pathway appears pivotal in regulating inflammatory responses, as highlighted by the dysregulation of NF-κB signaling and its link to the pathophysiology of RA (Roberti et al., 2022, Biology). Furthermore, oxidative stress plays a significant role in this context; resveratrol has been shown to inhibit NF-κB activation and mitigate oxidative stress effects by promoting the Nrf2 pathway, suggesting a therapeutic potential for modulating these interactions in RA (Zhang et al., 2019, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences). However, the interplay between oxidative stress and specific cytokine pathways like NF-κB remains underexplored, indicating a potential knowledge gap that warrants further investigation to identify novel therapeutic approaches (Behl et al., 2021, Molecules). Understanding these connections could pave the way for innovative treatments for RA that target oxidative stress modulation alongside inflammatory pathways.

The increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes is influenced by lncRNA linc00152, which activates the NF-κB pathway (Zhang et al., 2021, Immunity, Inflammation and Disease). This pathway appears pivotal in regulating inflammatory responses, as highlighted by the dysregulation of NF-κB signaling and its link to the pathophysiology of RA (Roberti et al., 2022, Biology). Furthermore, oxidative stress plays a significant role in this context; resveratrol has been shown to inhibit NF-κB activation and mitigate oxidative stress effects by promoting the Nrf2 pathway, suggesting a therapeutic potential for modulating these interactions in RA (Zhang et al., 2019, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences). However, the interplay between oxidative stress and specific cytokine pathways like NF-κB remains underexplored, indicating a potential knowledge gap that warrants further investigation to identify novel therapeutic approaches (Behl et al., 2021, Molecules). Understanding these connections could pave the way for innovative treatments for RA that target oxidative stress modulation alongside inflammatory pathways.

--- Paper 1: An integrative microenvironment approach for follicular lymphoma: roles of inflammatory cell subsets and immune-response polymorphisms on disease clinical course ---
The study of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in follicular lymphoma (FL) has produced conflicting results due to assessment of limited TME subpopulations, and because of heterogeneous treatments among different cohorts. Also, important genetic determinants of immune response, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), remain underexplored in this disease. We performed a detailed study of the TME in 169 FL biopsies using immunohistochemistry, encompassing lymphocytes, macrophages, and cytokines. We also genotyped 16 SNPs within key immune-response genes (IL12A, IL2, IL10, TGFB1, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, IL17A, and IL17F) in 159 patients. We tested associations between SNPs, clinicopathological features and TME composition, and proposed survival models in R-CHOP/R-CVP-treated patients. Presence of the IL12A rs568408 “A” allele associated with the follicular pattern of FOXP3+ cells. The IL12A AA haplotype included rs583911 and rs568408 and was an independent predictor of worse survival, together with the follicular patterns of T-cells (FOXP3+ and CD8+) and high IL-17F tumor levels. The patterns of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells, displayed as a principal component, also associated with survival. Hierarchical clustering of the TME proteins demonstrated a cluster that was associated with worse prognosis (tumors enriched in IL-17A, IL-17F, CD8, PD1, and Ki-67). The survival of FL patients who were treated in the rituximab era shows a strong dependence on TME signals, especially the T-cell infiltration patterns and IL-17F tumor levels. The presence of the AA haplotype of IL12A in the genome of FL patients is an additional prognostic factor that may modulate the composition of T-reg cells in this disease.

--- Paper 2: Ustekinumab Fails to Show Efficacy in a Phase III Axial Spondyloarthritis Program: The Importance of Negative Results ---
In this issue of Arthritis & Rheumatology, Deodhar et al report negative phase III study results for ustekinumab in axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) (1). Ustekinumab is an interleukin12 (IL12)/IL23 inhibitor approved for the treatment of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and Crohn’s disease. PsA has close clinical and genetic associations with axial SpA, including genetic association with variants in the IL23 receptor signaling pathway. In addition, ustekinumab demonstrated promising results in a phase II openlabel proofofconcept study among 20 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). In this previous study, ustekinumab at 90 mg was given subcutaneously (SC) at baseline and at weeks 4 and 16, and 65% of patients met the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society criteria for 40% improvement in disease activity (achieved an ASAS40 response) at 24 weeks (2). Many other outcomes also favored ustekinumab, including reduced evidence of inflammation on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These results suggested that ustekinumab’s benefits may be comparable to those of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL17 antagonists, 2 classes of agents approved for use in AS. Thus, the negative results of the phase III trial came as a real surprise, notwithstanding that the earlier study was not placebo controlled. The phase III program for ustekinumab was well designed and comprehensive. Three different studies were undertaken: one in patients with radiographic axial SpA (otherwise known as AS) who were naive to biologic therapy; a second in patients with radiographic axial SpA who were intolerant of (or whose disease was refractory to) a single TNF inhibitor (TNFi); and a third in patients with nonradiographic axial SpA who had an inadequate response to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and could have been exposed to a single TNFi. These are now standard populations for a phase III program in axial SpA. Patients were randomized to receive either 45 mg or 90 mg ustekinumab or placebo administered SC. Sample size estimates for all 3 studies were chosen to achieve 90% power to detect treatment differences between ustekinu mab and placebo for the primary end point at a significance level of 0.05. Estimates of 40% achieving an ASAS40 response in the treatment group and 20% in the placebo group were used for power calculation. What was demonstrated? At 24 weeks in study 1, the ASAS40 responses in the placebo, 45 mg ustekinumab, and 90 mg ustekinumab arms were 28.4%, 31.0%, and 28.1%, respectively, showing no separation between treatment arms and placebo. Other measures, including spine MRI, showed no significant separation between the treatment arms and placebo. Based on these negative results, the decision was made to stop the whole phase III study program; thus, studies 2 and 3 were not completed. Results for patients in those studies who did complete 24 weeks showed a similar lack of difference between placebo and treatment arms. Did biomarker analysis shed any light on the results? In study 1, several analytes at baseline were either correlated with disease activity according to the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) (3) or elevated compared with matched healthy controls. Critically, however, neither Th17 cytokines (IL17A, IL17F, IL22, and IL23) nor Th1 cytokines (interferonγ [IFNγ] and IL12p70) were dysregulated at baseline in AS patients compared with healthy controls. In study 2, with the TNFiexperienced population, there were greater elevations of inflammatory cytokines compared with study 1, including statistically significant elevations of IL17A, matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3), and MMP9, but not of IL17F, IFNγ, or IL12p70. In study 1, MMP3, serum amyloid A, and IL8 declined with ustekinumab treatment, but these changes were not correlated with any clinical change. The negative results raise many questions. How could the apparently positive results from the openlabel trial be so different from those of the controlled phase III trials? Why would a drug that has a modulating role in both the

--- Paper 3: Flavonoid apigenin modified gene expression associated with inflammation and cancer and induced apoptosis in human pancreatic cancer cells through inhibition of GSK-3β/NF-κB signaling cascade. ---
SCOPE
The objective was to examine the inhibitory effects of citrus fruit bioactive compounds on BxPC-3 and PANC-1 human pancreatic cancer cells, focusing on the antiproliferative mechanism of action of the flavonoid apigenin related to the glycogen synthase kinase-3β/nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Flavonoids, limonoids, phenolic acids, and ascorbic acid were tested for cytotoxic effects on BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cells; apigenin was the most potent (IC50 = 23 and 12 μM for 24 and 48 h for BxPC-3 and IC50 = 71 and 41 μM for 24 and 48 h for PANC-1). Apigenin induced pancreatic cell death through inhibition of the glycogen synthase kinase-3β/nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway. Apigenin arrested cell cycle at G2 /M phase (36 and 32% at 50 μM for BxPC-3 and PANC-1, respectively) with concomitant decrease in the expression of cyclin B1. Apigenin activated the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis (44 and 14% at 50 μM for BxPC-3 and PANC-1, respectively) and modified the expression of apoptotic proteins. Apigenin highly upregulated the expression of cytokine genes IL17F (114.2-fold), LTA (33.1-fold), IL17C (23.2-fold), IL17A (11.3-fold), and IFNB1 (8.9-fold) in BxPC-3 cells, which potentially contributed to the anticancer properties.


CONCLUSION
Flavonoids have a protective role in pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis.

--- Paper 4: Association of IL17 and IL23R gene polymorphisms with rheumatic heart disease in South Indian population ---
ABSTRACT Background: IL-23/Th17 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the cell-mediated immune response against bacterial infections and also in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Recent studies indicate that Th17 cell-associated cytokines are involved in the progression and maintenance of valvular lesions in rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Variants in the genes of cytokines that are potentially involved in Th17 response may influence interindividual differences in their expression levels, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases such as RHD. Objective: The aim of the study is to investigate the association of IL17A, IL17F, and IL23R gene variants with the risk perception of RHD. Methods: A total of 225 individuals (99 RHD patients and 126 healthy siblings) were recruited for the study. The IL17A (rs2275913), IL17F (rs763780), and IL23R (rs10889677) polymorphisms were determined by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphisms and amplification-refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction methods, respectively. Results: The frequency of IL17A (rs2275913) A/A genotype was significantly high in pooled RHD patients (odds ratio [OR] = 2.76; pc = 0.021), rheumatic fever (RF) patients (OR = 14.5; pc = 0.0001), and mitral valvular lesions patients (OR = 2.74; pc = 0.039) when compared to healthy siblings. However, the IL17F (rs763780) and IL23R (rs10889677) polymorphisms did not show any association with RHD. Conclusions: The results suggest that IL17A (rs2275913) polymorphism is associated with the development of RF/RHD in South Indian population. Further studies are required to substantiate the association of these genes with the disease risk.

--- Paper 5: An IL-17F.S65L Knock-In Mouse Reveals Similarities and Differences in IL-17F Function in Oral Candidiasis: A New Tool to Understand IL-17F ---
Key Points A murine IL-17F.S65L ortholog recapitulates the impaired signaling function in vitro. IL-17F.S65L knock-in mice are susceptible to oral candidiasis, unlike Il17f−/− mice. Il17fS65L/S65L mice may be a broadly valuable tool to interrogate IL-17F function. Visual Abstract Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) is an opportunistic infection of the oral mucosa caused by the commensal fungus Candida albicans. IL-17R signaling is essential to prevent OPC in mice and humans, but the individual roles of its ligands, IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-17AF, are less clear. A homozygous IL-17F deficiency in mice does not cause OPC susceptibility, whereas mice lacking IL-17A are moderately susceptible. In humans, a rare heterozygous mutation in IL-17F (IL-17F.S65L) was identified that causes chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, suggesting the existence of essential antifungal pathways mediated by IL-17F and/or IL-17AF. To investigate the role of IL-17F and IL-17AF in more detail, we exploited this “experiment of nature” by creating a mouse line bearing the homologous mutation in IL-17F (Ser65Leu) by CRISPR/Cas9. Unlike Il17f−/− mice that are resistant to OPC, Il17fS65L/S65L mice showed increased oral fungal burdens similar to Il17a−/− mice. In contrast to humans, however, disease was only evident in homozygous, not heterozygous, mutant mice. The mutation was linked to modestly impaired CXC chemokine expression and neutrophil recruitment to the infected tongue but not to alterations in oral antimicrobial peptide expression. These findings suggest mechanisms by which the enigmatic cytokine IL-17F contributes to host defense against fungi. Moreover, because these mice do not phenocopy Il17f−/− mice, they may provide a valuable tool to interrogate IL-17F and IL-17AF function in vivo in other settings.

The studies illustrate a complex relationship between cytokine signaling pathways and the expression of IL17A and IL17F in rheumatologic conditions. For example, the presence of IL-17F tumor levels in the tumor microenvironment of follicular lymphoma has been identified as a factor associated with poor survival (Assis-Mendonça et al., 2020, "An integrative microenvironment approach for follicular lymphoma"). Similarly, polymorphisms in IL17A have been linked to the increased risk and severity of rheumatic heart disease, emphasizing the IL-23/Th17 signaling pathway's role in inflammation and autoimmune responses (Poomarimuthu et al., 2018, "Association of IL17 and IL23R gene polymorphisms with rheumatic heart disease"). However, the findings regarding cytokine dysregulation in diseases like axial spondyloarthritis are conflicting; although some studies indicate no baseline dysregulation of key Th17 cytokines including IL17A and IL17F, others suggest significant variations depending on patient populations (Mease, 2019, "Ustekinumab Fails to Show Efficacy in a Phase III Axial Spondyloarthritis Program"). This discrepancy indicates a critical knowledge gap that may warrant further investigation into the role of genetic variants and environmental factors in modulating these cytokine pathways, particularly their influence on IL17A and IL17F expression in different rheumatologic contexts.

--- Paper 1: IL-17A/F-Signaling Does Not Contribute to the Initial Phase of Mucosal Inflammation Triggered by S. Typhimurium ---
Salmonella enterica subspecies 1 serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) causes diarrhea and acute inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17A and IL-17F are strongly induced in the infected mucosa but their contribution in driving the tissue inflammation is not understood. We have used the streptomycin mouse model to analyze the role of IL-17A and IL-17F and their cognate receptor IL-17RA in S. Typhimurium enterocolitis. Neutralization of IL-17A and IL-17F did not affect mucosal inflammation triggered by infection or spread of S. Typhimurium to systemic sites by 48 h p.i. Similarly, Il17ra−/− mice did not display any reduction in infection or inflammation by 12 h p.i. The same results were obtained using S. Typhimurium variants infecting via the TTSS1 type III secretion system, the TTSS1 effector SipA or the TTSS1 effector SopE. Moreover, the expression pattern of 45 genes encoding chemokines/cytokines (including CXCL1, CXCL2, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-1α, IL-1β, IFNγ, CXCL-10, CXCL-9, IL-6, CCL3, CCL4) and antibacterial molecules was not affected by Il17ra deficiency by 12 h p.i. Thus, in spite of the strong increase in Il17a/Il17f mRNA in the infected mucosa, IL-17RA signaling seems to be dispensable for eliciting the acute disease. Future work will have to address whether this is attributable to redundancy in the cytokine signaling network.

--- Paper 2: Bone marrow derived-mesenchymal stem cells downregulate IL17A dependent IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway in CCl4-induced rat liver fibrosis ---
Therapeutic potential of bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) has been reported in several animal models of liver fibrosis. Interleukin (IL) 17A, IL6 and Stat3 have been described to play crucial roles in chronic liver injury. However, the modulatory effect of MSCs on these markers was controversial in different diseases. BM-MSCs might activate the IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway and promote cell invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma, but the immunomodulatory role of BM-MSCs on IL17A/IL6/STAT3 was not fully elucidated in liver fibrosis. In the present study, we evaluated the capacity of the BM-MSCs in the modulation of cytokines milieu and signal transducers, based on unique inflammatory genes Il17a and Il17f and their receptors Il17rc and their effect on the IL6/STAT3 pathway in CCl4-induced liver fibrosis in rats. A single dose of BM-MSCs was administered to the group with induced liver fibrosis, and the genes and proteins of interest were evaluated along six weeks after treatment. Our results showed a significant downregulation of Il17a, Il17ra, il17f and Il17rc genes. In accordance, BM-MSCs administration declined IL17, IL2 and IL6 serum proteins and downregulated IL17A and IL17RA proteins in liver tissue. Interestingly, BM-MSCs downregulated both Stat3 mRNA expression and p-STAT3, while Stat5a gene was downregulated and p-STAT5 protein was elevated. Also P-SMAD3 and TGFβR2 proteins were downregulated in response to BM-MSCs treatment. Collectively, we suggest that BM-MSCs might play an immunomodulatory role in the treatment of liver fibrosis through downregulation of IL17A affecting IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway.

--- Paper 3: The selective anti‐IL17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab (AIN457) attenuates IL17A‐induced levels of IL6 in human astrocytes ---
The family of interleukin 17 receptors (IL17Rs), subtypes IL17RA‐IL17RE, is targeted by the group of pro‐inflammatory IL17 cytokines (IL17A‐F) and moreover the newly developed anti‐IL17A antibody secukinumab (AIN457) has shown promise in Phase II trials in multiple sclerosis. Here, we show that human astrocytes, isolated from a fetal cerebral cortex, express IL17RA and IL17RC and in vitro treatment with IL17A increases protein levels of IL6 in human astrocytes, which is enhanced in the presence of TNFα, as determined by homogeneous time resolved fluorescence. Studies on acutely isolated mouse astrocytes are comparable to human astrocytes although the protein levels of IL6 are lower in mouse astrocytes, which also show a lower response to IL17F and IL1β in promoting IL6 levels. In human astrocytes, IL17A and TNFα also induce mRNA expression of IL6, IL8 and the Th17 cytokines CXCL1, CXCL2, and CCL20, with little effect on Th1 cytokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. The effects of IL17A are associated with nuclear translocation of the NF‐κB transcription factor, as determined by immunocytochemistry, where treatment of human astrocytes with the inhibitors of the NF‐κB pathway and with secukinumab inhibits the IL17A and IL17A/TNFα‐induced increase in nuclear translocation of NF‐κB and levels of IL6. Taken together the data shows that IL17A signaling plays a key role in regulating the levels of cytokines, such as IL6, in human astrocytes via a mechanism that involves NF‐κB signaling and that selective inhibition of IL17A signaling attenuates levels of pro‐inflammatory molecules in astrocytes.

Background: Ustekinumab (UST) is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds the p40 epitope which is shared by IL12 and IL23, whereas guselkumab (GUS) is a mAb that selectively binds the p19 subunit of IL23. In recent studies, both UST (Phase 3 programs)1 and GUS (Phase 2 program)2 have demonstrated a reduction in musculoskeletal clinical signs and symptoms and improvement of psoriatic lesions in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), implicating the IL12/23 pathway in disease pathogenesis. Objectives: To explore the post-treatment pharmacodynamic changes of IL17A, IL17F, and CRP with GUS and UST in the context of PsA. Methods: Serum protein levels of IL17A, IL17F, and CRP were measured in 142 subjects and 38 matched healthy controls from the GUS Ph2 study2 at Weeks 0, 4, and 16. In the UST Ph3 studies1, biomarkers were assayed at Weeks 0, 4, and 24 as follows: IL17A (n=474), IL17F (n=237), CRP (n=927). IL17A and IL17F were assayed using Single Molecule CountingTM Human Immunoassay Kits (formerly Singulex). CRP was measured using CardioPhase hsCRP assay (UST studies) or Meso Scale Discovery Platform (GUS study). Results: At baseline, the Th17 effector cytokines IL17A and IL17F were elevated in the serum of PsA subjects in the GUS Ph2 cohort compared to healthy controls. IL17A and IL17F levels significantly correlated with affected skin body surface area, but not swollen or tender joint scores, in both studies. While none of the baseline levels of evaluated cytokines were associated with American College of Rheumatology (ACR) or Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) clinical responses to UST, baseline IL17F levels were modestly associated with ACR20 response to GUS at week 24. Both UST and GUS treatment resulted in pharmacodynamic decreases in IL17A, IL17F, and CRP levels, with GUS treatment restoring IL17A and IL17F levels to that of healthy controls by week 16. Consistent with being a component of ACR scores, CRP changes were significantly associated with ACR20 responses to both UST and GUS treatment. Weeks 4 and 16 changes in IL17F with GUS treatment were significantly associated with ACR20 response at week 24. Week 24 PASI75 response to GUS was significantly associated with week 4 changes in IL17A, with a similar trend observed at Week 16. Conclusion: These results underscore the relevance of the IL23/Th17 pathway in PsA, with GUS treatment providing a stronger suppression of the pathway than UST treatment. The significant associations of changes in IL17A and IL17F levels with GUS treatment with PASI75 and ACR20 response, respectively, support the importance of the IL23/Th17 pathway for both skin and joint pathologies. The associations of reduction in CRP levels with both UST and GUS treatment also reinforce the role of acute phase inflammation in joint pathology. References: [1] Deodhar A, Kavanaugh A, et al.

--- Paper 5: Inferred Causal Mechanisms of Persistent FMDV Infection in Cattle from Differential Gene Expression in the Nasopharyngeal Mucosa ---
Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) can persistently infect pharyngeal epithelia in ruminants but not in pigs. Our previous studies demonstrated that persistent FMDV infection in cattle was associated with under-expression of several chemokines that recruit immune cells. This report focuses on the analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEG) identified during the transitional phase of infection, defined as the period when animals diverge between becoming carriers or terminators. During this phase, Th17-stimulating cytokines (IL6 and IL23A) and Th17-recruiting chemokines (CCL14 and CCL20) were upregulated in animals that were still infected (transitional carriers) compared to those that had recently cleared infection (terminators), whereas chemokines recruiting neutrophils and CD8+ T effector cells (CCL3 and ELR+CXCLs) were downregulated. Upregulated Th17-specific receptor, CCR6, and Th17-associated genes, CD146, MIR155, and ThPOK, suggested increased Th17 cell activity in transitional carriers. However, a complex interplay of the Th17 regulatory axis was indicated by non-significant upregulation of IL17A and downregulation of IL17F, two hallmarks of TH17 activity. Other DEG suggested that transitional carriers had upregulated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), non-canonical NFκB signaling, and downregulated canonical NFκB signaling. The results described herein provide novel insights into the mechanisms of establishment of FMDV persistence. Additionally, the fact that ruminants, unlike pigs, produce a large amount of AHR ligands suggests a plausible explanation of why FMDV persists in ruminants, but not in pigs.

Cytokine signaling pathways, particularly those involving IL-17A and IL-17F, play a significant role in various rheumatologic conditions. Evidence from studies indicates that IL-17A contributes to inflammation, as observed in its association with the elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 in human astrocytes (The selective anti‐IL17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab (AIN457) attenuates IL17A‐induced levels of IL6 in human astrocytes by G. Elain et al., Glia, 2014). Furthermore, in the context of psoriatic arthritis, treatment with the monoclonal antibodies Ustekinumab and Guselkumab revealed significant reductions in serum levels of IL-17A and IL-17F post-treatment, correlating with clinical responses, which highlights the Th17 pathway's involvement in disease management (THU0052 USTEKINUMAB AND GUSELKUMAB TREATMENT RESULTS IN DIFFERENCES IN SERUM IL17A, IL17F AND CRP LEVELS IN PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS PATIENTS by S. Siebert et al., Poster Presentations, 2019). However, the role of IL-17 signaling can be complex; for instance, in the context of liver fibrosis, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells were found to downregulate IL-17A and IL-17F expression, suggesting a potential immunomodulatory role that may intersect with cytokine signaling pathways (Bone marrow derived-mesenchymal stem cells downregulate IL17A dependent IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway in CCl4-induced rat liver fibrosis by S. Farouk et al., PLoS ONE, 2018). The collective findings suggest a need for more research to delineate the nuances of IL-17 signaling in various inflammatory contexts, particularly how these pathways might inform therapeutic strategies across different rheumatologic conditions.

Context Relationship: cytokine signaling pathways crucial for rheumatologic conditions - influence expression of - IL17A and IL17F genes

Papers Provided (Abstracts):
--- Paper 1: The binding activity of Mel‐18 at the Il17a promoter is regulated by the integrated signals of the TCR and polarizing cytokines ---
We have previously shown that in differentiated T‐helper (Th)1 and Th2 cells, polycomb group (PcG) proteins are associated differentially with the promoters of the signature cytokine genes. The correlation of the binding activity of PcG proteins with gene expression is unusual, since they are well known as epigenetic regulators that maintain transcriptional silencing. Here we show that in Th17 cells, the more phenotypically flexible Th lineage, the PcG proteins Mel‐18 and less strikingly Ezh2 are associated differentially with the Il17a promoter. Using the RNAi approach, we found that Mel‐18 and Ezh2 positively regulate the expression of Il17a and Il17f. The inducible binding of Mel‐18 and Ezh2 at the Il17a promoter was dependent on signaling pathways downstream of the TCR. However, a continuous presence of TGF‐β, the cytokine that is necessary to maintain Il17a expression, was required to preserve the binding activity of Mel‐18, but not of Ezh2, following restimulation. The binding of Mel‐18 at the Il17a promoter was correlated with the recruitment of the lineage‐specifying transcription factor RORγt. Altogether, our results suggest that in Th17 cells the TCR and polarizing cytokines synergize to modulate the binding activity of Mel‐18 at the Il17a promoter, and consequently to facilitate Il17a expression.

--- Paper 2: Differential mucosal expression of Th17-related genes between the inflamed colon and ileum of patients with inflammatory bowel disease ---
BackgroundImmunological and genetic findings implicate Th17 effector cytokines in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Expression of Th17 pathway-associated genes is mainly studied in colonic disease. The present study assessed the mRNA expression levels of Th17 effector cytokines (IL17A, IL17F, IL21, IL22 and IL26) and genes involved in differentiation (IL6, IL1B, TGFB1, IL23A and STAT3) and recruitment of Th17 cells (CCR6 and CCL20) by quantitative real-time PCR analysis of colonic and ileal biopsies from 22 healthy control subjects, 26 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 12 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Inflammation was quantified by measuring expression of the inflammatory mediators IL8 and TNF.ResultsEvaluation of mRNA expression levels in colonic and ileal control samples revealed that TNF, TGFB1, STAT3 and CCR6 were expressed at higher levels in the ileum than in the colon. Expression of all the Th17 pathway-associated genes was increased in inflamed colonic samples. The increased expression of these genes was predominantly observed in samples from UC patients and was associated with more intense inflammation. Although increased expression of IL17A, IL17F, IL21 and IL26 was detected in inflamed ileal samples, expression of the indispensable Th17 cell differentiation factors TGFB1 and IL23A, the signaling molecule STAT3 and the Th17 recruitment factors CCR6 and CCL20 were unchanged.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that immune regulation is different in colonic and ileal disease, which might have important consequences for therapeutic intervention.

--- Paper 3: Generation of Pathogenic Th17 Cells in the Absence of TGF-β Signaling ---
CD4+ T-helper cells that selectively produce interleukin (IL)-17 (TH17), are critical for host defence and autoimmunity. Although crucial for TH17 cells in vivo, IL-23 has been thought to be incapable of driving initial differentiation. Rather, IL-6 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 have been proposed to be the factors responsible for initiating specification. Here we show that TH17 differentiation can occur in the absence of TGF-β signalling. Neither IL-6 nor IL-23 alone efficiently generated TH17 cells; however, these cytokines in combination with IL-1β effectively induced IL-17 production in naive precursors, independently of TGF-β. Epigenetic modification of the Il17a, Il17f and Rorc promoters proceeded without TGF-β1, allowing the generation of cells that co-expressed RORγt (encoded by Rorc) and T-bet. T-bet+RORγt+ TH17 cells are generated in vivo during experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, and adoptively transferred TH17 cells generated with IL-23 without TGF-β1 were pathogenic in this disease model. These data indicate an alternative mode for TH17 differentiation. Consistent with genetic data linking IL23R with autoimmunity, our findings re-emphasize the importance of IL-23 and therefore may have therapeutic implications.

--- Paper 4: The TLR9 Agonist Cobitolimod Induces IL10-Producing Wound Healing Macrophages and Regulatory T Cells in Ulcerative Colitis ---
Abstract Background and Aims The topically applied Toll-like receptor 9 [TLR9] agonist cobitolimod is a first-in-class DNA-based oligonucleotide with demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials with ulcerative colitis [UC] patients. We here characterized its anti-inflammatory mechanism in UC. Methods Luminal cobitolimod administration was evaluated in an experimental dextran sodium sulfate [DSS]-induced colitis model. Cultured blood and mucosal cells from UC patients were treated with cobitolimod and analysed via microarray, quantitative real-time PCR, ELISA and flow cytometry. Intestinal slides of cobitolimod-treated UC patients were analysed by immunohistochemistry. Results Cobitolimod administration markedly suppressed experimental colitis activity, and microarray analyses demonstrated mucosal IL10 upregulation and suppression of IL17 signalling pathways. Cobitolimod treatment was associated with significant induction of mucosal IL10+Tr1 and Treg cells and suppression of Th17 cells. TLR9 knockout mice indicated that cobitolimod requires TLR9 signalling for IL10 induction. In UC patients, mucosal TLR9 levels correlated with severity of inflammation. Cobitolimod inhibited IL17A and IL17F, but increased IL10 and FoxP3 expression in cultured intestinal UC T cells. Cobitolimod-mediated suppression of intestinal IL17+T cells was abrogated by IL10 blockade. Furthermore, cobitolimod led to heightened IL10 production by wound healing macrophages. Immunohistochemistry in intestinal biopsies of cobitolimod-treated UC patients indicated increased presence of IL10+mononuclear and regulatory T cells, as well as reduction of IL17+cells. Conclusion Activation of TLR9 via cobitolimod might represent a novel therapeutic approach in UC, as it suppresses Th17 cells and induces anti-inflammatory IL10+macrophages and regulatory T cells, thereby modifying the dysregulated intestinal cytokine balance.

--- Paper 5: Mucocutaneous candidiasis: the IL-17 pathway and implications for targeted immunotherapy ---
IL-17 and related cytokines are direct and indirect targets of selective immunosuppressive agents for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and other diseases of pathologic inflammation. Insights into the potential adverse effects of IL-17 blockade can be drawn from the experience of patients with deficiencies in the IL-17 pathway. A unifying theme of susceptibility to mucocutaneous candidiasis is seen in both mice and humans with a variety of genetic defects that converge on this pathway. Mucocutaneous candidiasis is a superficial infection of mucosal, nail or skin surfaces usually caused by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. The morbidity of the disease includes significant pain, weight loss and secondary complications, including carcinoma and aneurysms. This review describes the known human diseases associated with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) as well as the known and proposed connections to IL-17 signaling. The human diseases include defects in IL-17 signaling due to autoantibodies (AIRE deficiency), receptor mutations (IL-17 receptor mutations) or mutations in the cytokine genes (IL17F and IL17A). Hyper-IgE syndrome is characterized by elevated serum IgE, dermatitis and recurrent infections, including CMC due to impaired generation of IL-17-producing Th17 cells. Mutations in STAT1, IL12B and IL12RB1 result in CMC secondary to decreased IL-17 production through different mechanisms. Dectin-1 defects and CARD9 defects result in susceptibility to C. albicans because of impaired host recognition of the pathogen and subsequent impaired generation of IL-17-producing T cells. Thus, recent discoveries of genetic predisposition to CMC have driven the recognition of the role of IL-17 in protection from mucosal fungal infection and should guide counseling and management of patients treated with pharmacologic IL-17 blockade.

Cytokine signaling pathways, particularly those involving TGF-β, IL-6, and IL-23, play crucial roles in the expression of IL17A and IL17F genes, which are integral to the pathogenesis of various rheumatologic conditions. For example, Mel-18 and Ezh2, which are influenced by TCR signaling, positively regulate the expression of IL17A and IL17F in Th17 cells, demonstrating the synergy of different cytokine signals (Reut Hod-Dvorai et al., European Journal of Immunology, 2011). Additionally, while IL-6 and IL-1β can drive IL-17 production independently of TGF-β, highlighting an alternative pathway for TH17 differentiation (K. Ghoreschi et al., Nature, 2010), the expression of IL17A and IL17F is significantly elevated in inflamed tissues from IBD patients, suggesting a direct link between inflammatory signals and these cytokines (S. Bogaert et al., BMC Immunology, 2010). Furthermore, the TLR9 agonist cobitolimod was shown to suppress IL17A and IL17F while inducing IL10-producing regulatory T cells and macrophages, pointing to potential therapeutic pathways targeting these cytokines in ulcerative colitis (Heike Schmitt et al., Journal of Crohn's & Colitis, 2019). The contrasting mechanisms through which various cytokines regulate IL-17 expression indicate potential gaps in understanding the nuances of cytokine interactions, which may guide future hypotheses regarding therapeutic interventions for autoimmune diseases (A. Huppler et al., Arthritis Research & Therapy, 2012).

Papers Provided (Abstracts):
--- Paper 1: Epigenetic regulation of Plasmodium falciparum clonally variant gene expression during development in Anopheles gambiae ---
P. falciparum phenotypic plasticity is linked to the variant expression of clonal multigene families such as the var genes. We have examined changes in transcription and histone modifications that occur during sporogonic development of P. falciparum in the mosquito host. All var genes are silenced or transcribed at low levels in blood stages (gametocyte/ring) of the parasite in the human host. After infection of mosquitoes, a single var gene is selected for expression in the oocyst, and transcription of this gene increases dramatically in the sporozoite. The same PF3D7_1255200 var gene was activated in 4 different experimental infections. Transcription of this var gene during parasite development in the mosquito correlates with the presence of low levels of H3K9me3 at the binding site for the PF3D7_1466400 AP2 transcription factor. This chromatin state in the sporozoite also correlates with the expression of an antisense long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that has previously been shown to promote var gene transcription during the intraerythrocytic cycle in vitro. Expression of both the sense protein-coding transcript and the antisense lncRNA increase dramatically in sporozoites. The findings suggest a complex process for the activation of a single particular var gene that involves AP2 transcription factors and lncRNAs.

--- Paper 2: Epigenetic regulation of gene expression in cancer: techniques, resources and analysis ---
Cancer is a complex disease, driven by aberrant activity in numerous signaling pathways in even individual malignant cells. Epigenetic changes are critical mediators of these functional changes that drive and maintain the malignant phenotype. Changes in DNA methylation, histone acetylation and methylation, non-coding RNAs, post-translational modifications are all epigenetic drivers in cancer, independent of changes in the DNA sequence. These epigenetic alterations, once thought to be crucial only for the malignant phenotype maintenance, are now recognized as critical also for disrupting essential pathways that protect the cells from uncontrolled growth, longer survival and establishment in distant sites from the original tissue. In this review, we focus on DNA methylation and chromatin structure in cancer. While associated with cancer, the precise functional role of these alterations is an area of active research using emerging high-throughput approaches and bioinformatics analysis tools. Therefore, this review describes these high-throughput measurement technologies, public domain databases for high-throughput epigenetic data in tumors and model systems, and bioinformatics algorithms for their analysis. Advances in bioinformatics data integration techniques that combine these epigenetic data with genomics data are essential to infer the function of specific epigenetic alterations in cancer, and are therefore also a focus of this review. Future studies using these emerging technologies will elucidate how alterations in the cancer epigenome cooperate with genetic aberrations to cause tumorigenesis initiation and progression. This deeper understanding is essential to future studies that will precisely infer patients’ prognosis and select patients who will be responsive to emerging epigenetic therapies.

--- Paper 3: Metabolic regulation of gene expression by histone lactylation ---
The Warburg effect, which originally described increased production of lactate in cancer, is associated with diverse cellular processes such as angiogenesis, hypoxia, polarization of macrophages and activation of T cells. This phenomenon is intimately linked to several diseases including neoplasia, sepsis and autoimmune diseases1,2. Lactate, which is converted from pyruvate in tumour cells, is widely known as an energy source and metabolic by-product. However, its non-metabolic functions in physiology and disease remain unknown. Here we show that lactate-derived lactylation of histone lysine residues serves as an epigenetic modification that directly stimulates gene transcription from chromatin. We identify 28 lactylation sites on core histones in human and mouse cells. Hypoxia and bacterial challenges induce the production of lactate by glycolysis, and this acts as a precursor that stimulates histone lactylation. Using M1 macrophages that have been exposed to bacteria as a model system, we show that histone lactylation has different temporal dynamics from acetylation. In the late phase of M1 macrophage polarization, increased histone lactylation induces homeostatic genes that are involved in wound healing, including Arg1. Collectively, our results suggest that an endogenous ‘lactate clock’ in bacterially challenged M1 macrophages turns on gene expression to promote homeostasis. Histone lactylation thus represents an opportunity to improve our understanding of the functions of lactate and its role in diverse pathophysiological conditions, including infection and cancer. The lactylation of lysine residues on histones in mammalian cells is stimulated by hypoxia and bacterial challenges, and increased histone lactylation induces genes involved in wound healing.

--- Paper 4: Regulation of gene expression by altered promoter methylation using a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated epigenetic editing system ---
Despite the increased interest in epigenetic research, its progress has been hampered by a lack of satisfactory tools to control epigenetic factors in specific genomic regions. Until now, many attempts to manipulate DNA methylation have been made using drugs but these drugs are not target-specific and have global effects on the whole genome. However, due to new genome editing technologies, potential epigenetic factors can now possibly be regulated in a site-specific manner. Here, we demonstrate the utility of CRISPR/Cas9 to modulate methylation at specific CpG sites and to elicit gene expression. We targeted the murine Oct4 gene which is transcriptionally locked due to hypermethylation at the promoter region in NIH3T3 cells. To induce site-specific demethylation at the Oct4 promoter region and its gene expression, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in and CRISPR/dCas9-Tet1 systems. Using these two approaches, we induced site-specific demethylation at the Oct4 promoter and confirmed the up-regulation of Oct4 expression. Furthermore, we confirmed that the synergistic effect of DNA demethylation and other epigenetic regulations increased the expression of Oct4 significantly. Based on our research, we suggest that our proven epigenetic editing methods can selectively modulate epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation and have promise for various applications in epigenetics.

--- Paper 5: Modifiable risk factors in periodontal disease: epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the inflammatory response. ---
Epigenetics as a modifiable risk factor in periodontal diseases has been investigated in light of the current knowledge of how chronic infection and inflammation can affect gene-specific epigenetic reprogramming in periodontal tissues. Epigenomic programming might be particularly sensitive to environmental influences, and a combination of physiological stressors and environmental exposures appears to affect the epigenomic program acquired by a cell during differentiation and throughout the cellular lineage lifespan. Viral and bacterial infections can establish several types of epigenetic modifications, which sometimes engage in a complex epigenetic crosstalk also reflecting in the establishment and progress of periodontal diseases. The inflammatory and metabolic states of the periodontal tissues are driven by the infectious stimuli, and the magnitude of the cellular and molecular signature response is further dictated by the host genetic and epigenetic traits associated with various systemic exposures, including smoking, obesity and diabetes/hyperglycemia. This review discusses the advances in epigenetics, focusing on the role of DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease and the potential of epigenetic therapy.

The provided abstracts lack direct information on the relationship between IL17A and IL17F gene expression and epigenetic modifications impacting histone acetylation. However, several studies do discuss the broader concept of epigenetic regulation and chromatin modifications relevant to gene expression. For instance, Paper 2 highlights the significance of epigenetic changes in tumor biology, including histone acetylation and its role in altering gene expression profiles in cancer contexts (Kagohara et al., bioRxiv, 2017). Paper 4 demonstrates that CRISPR/Cas9 technology can specifically modulate DNA methylation and potentially influence gene expression, indicating that targeted epigenetic editing could impact the expression of genes like IL17A and IL17F (Kang et al., Scientific Reports, 2019). Additionally, Paper 5 discusses the role of environmental factors in epigenetic programming of gene expression, which may suggest a link to inflammatory responses where IL17 cytokines are involved, albeit not directly linking to histone modifications (Barros & Offenbacher, Periodontology, 2014). 

Further research could explore how specific environmental or metabolic factors modulate histone acetylation states of IL17A and IL17F, potentially harnessing insights from Paper 3, which examines the role of lactate-induced histone modifications during immune response (Zhang et al., Nature, 2019). This could lead to novel therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic pathways to modulate IL17-related inflammatory diseases.

Additionally, Paper 5 discusses the role of environmental factors in epigenetic programming of gene expression, which may suggest a link to inflammatory responses where IL17 cytokines are involved, albeit not directly linking to histone modifications (Barros & Offenbacher, Periodontology, 2014). 

Further research could explore how specific environmental or metabolic factors modulate histone acetylation states of IL17A and IL17F, potentially harnessing insights from Paper 3, which examines the role of lactate-induced histone modifications during immune response (Zhang et al., Nature, 2019). This could lead to novel therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic pathways to modulate IL17-related inflammatory diseases.

--- Paper 1: Epigenetic regulation of Il12 and Il23 gene expression and autoimmune inflammation by the deubiquitinase Trabid ---
The proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 12 (IL-12) and IL-23 connect innate responses and adaptive immune responses and are also involved in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Here we describe an epigenetic mechanism for regulation of the genes encoding IL-12 (Il12a and Il12b; collectively called 'Il12' here) and IL-23 (Il23a and Il12b; collectively called 'Il23' here) involving the deubiquitinase Trabid. Deletion of Zranb1 (which encodes Trabid) in dendritic cells inhibited induction of the expression of Il12 and Il23 by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which impaired the differentiation of inflammatory T cells and protected mice from autoimmune inflammation. Trabid facilitated TLR-induced histone modifications at the promoters of Il12 and Il23, which involved deubiqutination and stabilization of the histone demethylase Jmjd2d. Our findings highlight an epigenetic mechanism for the regulation of Il12 and Il23 and establish Trabid as an innate immunological regulator of inflammatory T cell responses.

--- Paper 2: Epigenetic regulation of placental gene expression in transcriptional subtypes of preeclampsia ---
BackgroundPreeclampsia (PE) is a heterogeneous, hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, with no robust biomarkers or effective treatments. We hypothesized that this heterogeneity is due to the existence of multiple subtypes of PE and, in support of this hypothesis, we recently identified five clusters of placentas within a large gene expression microarray dataset (N = 330), of which four (clusters 1, 2, 3, and 5) contained a substantial number of PE samples. However, while transcriptional analysis of placentas can subtype patients, we propose that the addition of epigenetic information could discern gene regulatory mechanisms behind the distinct PE pathologies, as well as identify clinically useful potential biomarkers.ResultsWe subjected 48 of our samples from transcriptional clusters 1, 2, 3, and 5 to Infinium HumanMethylation450 arrays. Samples belonging to transcriptional clusters 1–3 still showed visible relationships to each other by methylation, but cluster 5, with known chromosomal abnormalities, no longer formed a cohesive group. Within transcriptional clusters 2 and 3, controlling for fetal sex and gestational age in the identification of differentially methylated sites, compared to the healthier cluster 1, dramatically reduced the number of significant sites, but increased the percentage that demonstrated a strong linear correlation with gene expression (from 5% and 2% to 9% and 8%, respectively). Locations exhibiting a positive relationship between methylation and gene expression were most frequently found in CpG open sea enhancer regions within the gene body, while those with a significant negative correlation were often annotated to the promoter in a CpG shore region. Integrated transcriptome and epigenome analysis revealed modifications in TGF-beta signaling, cell adhesion, oxidative phosphorylation, and metabolism pathways in cluster 2 placentas, and aberrations in antigen presentation, allograft rejection, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction in cluster 3 samples.ConclusionsOverall, we have established DNA methylation alterations underlying a portion of the transcriptional development of “canonical” PE in cluster 2 and “immunological” PE in cluster 3. However, a significant number of the observed methylation changes were not associated with corresponding changes in gene expression, and vice versa, indicating that alternate methods of gene regulation will need to be explored to fully comprehend these PE subtypes.

--- Paper 3: Epigenetic regulation in metabolic diseases: mechanisms and advances in clinical study ---
Epigenetics regulates gene expression and has been confirmed to play a critical role in a variety of metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), osteoporosis, gout, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism and others. The term ‘epigenetics’ was firstly proposed in 1942 and with the development of technologies, the exploration of epigenetics has made great progresses. There are four main epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodelling, and noncoding RNA (ncRNA), which exert different effects on metabolic diseases. Genetic and non-genetic factors, including ageing, diet, and exercise, interact with epigenetics and jointly affect the formation of a phenotype. Understanding epigenetics could be applied to diagnosing and treating metabolic diseases in the clinic, including epigenetic biomarkers, epigenetic drugs, and epigenetic editing. In this review, we introduce the brief history of epigenetics as well as the milestone events since the proposal of the term ‘epigenetics’. Moreover, we summarise the research methods of epigenetics and introduce four main general mechanisms of epigenetic modulation. Furthermore, we summarise epigenetic mechanisms in metabolic diseases and introduce the interaction between epigenetics and genetic or non-genetic factors. Finally, we introduce the clinical trials and applications of epigenetics in metabolic diseases.

--- Paper 4: Oxidized Guanine Base Lesions Function in 8-Oxoguanine DNA Glycosylase-1-mediated Epigenetic Regulation of Nuclear Factor κB-driven Gene Expression* ---
A large percentage of redox-responsive gene promoters contain evolutionarily conserved guanine-rich clusters; guanines are the bases most susceptible to oxidative modification(s). Consequently, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is one of the most abundant base lesions in promoters and is primarily repaired via the 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1 (OOG1)-initiated base excision repair pathway. In view of a prompt cellular response to oxidative challenge, we hypothesized that the 8-oxoG lesion and the cognate repair protein OGG1 are utilized in transcriptional gene activation. Here, we document TNFα-induced enrichment of both 8-oxoG and OGG1 in promoters of pro-inflammatory genes, which precedes interaction of NF-κB with its DNA-binding motif. OGG1 bound to 8-oxoG upstream from the NF-κB motif increased its DNA occupancy by promoting an on-rate of both homodimeric and heterodimeric forms of NF-κB. OGG1 depletion decreased both NF-κB binding and gene expression, whereas Nei-like glycosylase-1 and -2 had a marginal effect. These results are the first to document a novel paradigm wherein the DNA repair protein OGG1 bound to its substrate is coupled to DNA occupancy of NF-κB and functions in epigenetic regulation of gene expression.

--- Paper 5: Genetic and epigenetic regulation of gene expression in fetal and adult human livers ---
The liver plays a central role in the maintenance of homeostasis and health in general. However, there is substantial inter-individual variation in hepatic gene expression, and although numerous genetic factors have been identified, less is known about the epigenetic factors. By analyzing the methylomes and transcriptomes of 14 fetal and 181 adult livers, we identified 657 differentially methylated genes with adult-specific expression, these genes were enriched for transcription factor binding sites of HNF1A and HNF4A. We also identified 1,000 genes specific to fetal liver, which were enriched for GATA1, STAT5A, STAT5B and YY1 binding sites. We saw strong liver-specific effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms on both methylation levels (28,447 unique CpG sites (meQTL)) and gene expression levels (526 unique genes (eQTL)), at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. Of the 526 unique eQTL associated genes, 293 correlated significantly not only with genetic variation but also with methylation levels. The tissue-specificities of these associations were analyzed in muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue and visceral adipose tissue. We observed that meQTL were more stable between tissues than eQTL and a very strong tissue-specificity for the identified associations between CpG methylation and gene expression. Our analyses generated a comprehensive resource of factors involved in the regulation of hepatic gene expression, and allowed us to estimate the proportion of variation in gene expression that could be attributed to genetic and epigenetic variation, both crucial to understanding differences in drug response and the etiology of liver diseases.

The relationship between IL17A and IL17F gene expression and epigenetic modifications, particularly histone acetylation, is not directly addressed in the provided papers. However, key insights into epigenetic regulation mechanisms can be drawn from several studies. 

For instance, research highlights the role of histone modifications in regulating pro-inflammatory cytokine genes including IL-12 and IL-23 via the deubiquitinase Trabid, which facilitates TLR-induced histone modifications (Jin Jin et al., 2015, Nature Immunology). Although IL-17 family cytokines were not explicitly mentioned, this suggests a broader regulatory framework involving histone acetylation that could encompass IL17A and IL17F. Additionally, the substantial role of epigenetic factors is reiterated in various contexts, notably within metabolic diseases where histone modifications are critical mechanisms (Yan-Lin Wu et al., 2023, Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy).

Moreover, the comprehensive study of hepatic gene expression underscores inter-individual variations influenced by epigenetic factors, indicating that such mechanisms are critical across various tissues and conditions (M. Bonder et al., 2014, BMC Genomics). Therefore, while the specific connection to IL17A and IL17F is not explicitly established, the frameworks of epigenetic regulation discussed open avenues for investigating how these genes might also be regulated through similar histone acetylation modifications. This represents a potential knowledge gap, suggesting a need for studies focused specifically on IL17A and IL17F in the context of histone acetylation.

--- Paper 1: Epigenetic regulation mechanisms of microRNA expression ---
Abstract MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded RNAs of 18–25 nucleotides that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. They are involved in many physiological and pathological processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, development and carcinogenesis. Because of the central role of miRNAs in the regulation of gene expression, their expression needs to be tightly controlled. Here, we summarize the different mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of miRNAs, with a particular focus on DNA methylation and histone modification.

--- Paper 2: Epigenetic regulation of lateralized fetal spinal gene expression underlies hemispheric asymmetries ---
Lateralization is a fundamental principle of nervous system organization but its molecular determinants are mostly unknown. In humans, asymmetric gene expression in the fetal cortex has been suggested as the molecular basis of handedness. However, human fetuses already show considerable asymmetries in arm movements before the motor cortex is functionally linked to the spinal cord, making it more likely that spinal gene expression asymmetries form the molecular basis of handedness. We analyzed genome-wide mRNA expression and DNA methylation in cervical and anterior thoracal spinal cord segments of five human fetuses and show development-dependent gene expression asymmetries. These gene expression asymmetries were epigenetically regulated by miRNA expression asymmetries in the TGF-β signaling pathway and lateralized methylation of CpG islands. Our findings suggest that molecular mechanisms for epigenetic regulation within the spinal cord constitute the starting point for handedness, implying a fundamental shift in our understanding of the ontogenesis of hemispheric asymmetries in humans.

--- Paper 3: Epigenetic balance of gene expression by Polycomb and COMPASS families ---
A balancing act in modifying chromatin Chromatin modifiers add chemical groups to histones, the proteins that package DNA. These modifications are central to cellular development, and mutations in their molecular machinery are linked to a variety of human diseases. Piunti and Shilatifard review the balance between the prototypic chromatin modifiers Polycomb and COMPASS complexes and their role in gene regulation and normal development. Although originally identified as indispensible regulators of fruit fly development, related roles have been identified in other organisms. Furthermore, mutations in human homologs have been implicated in various cancers. As such, these complexes may serve as effective targets for epigenetic therapies. Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad9780 BACKGROUND Multicellular organisms depend on the precise orchestration of gene expression to direct embryonic development and to maintain tissue homeostasis through their life spans. Exactly how such cell type–specific patterns of gene expression are established, maintained, and passed on to the next generation is one of the most fundamental questions of biology. Eukaryotes package their DNA into nucleosomes to form chromatin fibers. Chromatin plays a central role in regulating accessibility to DNA in many different DNA templated processes, including machineries that transcribe DNA into RNA, i.e., transcription. Transcriptional control through sequence-specific DNA binding factors (transcription factors) is well established; however, proteins that change chromatin structure (chromatin modifiers and remodelers) provide an additional layer of regulation and are considered major epigenetic determinants of cell identity and function. Among the numerous chromatin modifiers, the members of the Polycomb group (PcG) and the Trithorax group (TrxG) of proteins, in particular, have been scrutinized genetically and biochemically for decades. However, new and unexpected functions for these complexes are constantly emerging because of the intense interest in the critical role these proteins play in maintaining a balanced state of gene expression. ADVANCES In the classical view, PcG and TrxG proteins regulate the repressed and activated states of gene expression, respectively. Both PcG and TrxG are organized in multiprotein complexes, which include the Polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2, respectively), and the complex of proteins associated with Set1 (COMPASS) family. Polycomb and COMPASS families are well known for their opposing roles in balancing gene expression, a phenomenon initially characterized using classical Drosophila melanogaster genetic approaches at a time when their biochemical functions were still unknown. Later studies demonstrated that Polycomb and COMPASS complexes have enzymatic activities modifying different sites on a common target, the nucleosome. Nucleosomes can be posttranslationally modified in a variety of ways, many of which strongly correlate with different states of gene expression. Through their ability to regulate gene expression, several components of both the Polycomb and COMPASS complexes are involved in a plethora of crucial biological processes ranging from the regulation of embryonic development to widespread involvement in neoplastic pathogenesis. OUTLOOK Recent genome-wide studies have demonstrated that a large number of the components of the Polycomb and COMPASS families are often mutated in different forms of cancer. Some mutations result in gene deletion or early termination, such as loss-of-function (LOF) mutations, whereas gain-of-function (GOF) mutations increase or change their normal activities. Although it cannot be excluded that some of those are passenger rather than driver mutations, they suggest a relevant function of these proteins in tumorigenesis. Moreover, animal models have provided convincing evidence supporting a role for these complexes in tumor progression. However, even after decades of study, how Polycomb and COMPASS control normal or aberrant gene regulatory networks is not fully understood yet. From the perspective of their catalytic activities, the degree to which catalytic versus noncatalytic functions contribute to their roles in development and cancer has just begun to emerge. Concurrently, the possibility that PcG and TrxG enzymatic activities modify non-nucleosome substrates remains a fascinating, although largely unexplored, hypothesis. Ongoing efforts to decipher how mutations affecting members of these complexes disturb transcriptional balances and promote oncogenesis could provide critically needed new strategies for cancer therapeutics. The balanced state of gene expression. The scale symbolizes the transcriptional status of a gene. Each dish contains a nucleosome that is either lysine 4 trimethylated (green light) or lysine 27 tri-methylated (red light) on histone H3 (one tail is depicted for simplicity). These two histone marks strongly correlate, respectively, with transcriptional activation induced by COMPASS and transcriptional repression induced by PcG. [Figure by Mark Miller. Nucleosomes are adapted from a custom model from 3D Molecular Designs] Epigenetic regulation of gene expression in metazoans is central for establishing cellular diversity, and its deregulation can result in pathological conditions. Although transcription factors are essential for implementing gene expression programs, they do not function in isolation and require the recruitment of various chromatin-modifying and -remodeling machineries. A classic example of developmental chromatin regulation is the balanced activities of the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins within the PRC1 and PRC2 complexes, and the Trithorax group (TrxG) proteins within the COMPASS family, which are highly mutated in a large number of human diseases. In this review, we will discuss the latest findings regarding the properties of the PcG and COMPASS families and the insight they provide into the epigenetic control of transcription under physiological and pathological settings.

--- Paper 4: DNA hypermethylation associated with upregulated gene expression in prostate cancer demonstrates the diversity of epigenetic regulation ---
Prostate cancer (PCa) has the highest incidence rates of cancers in men in western countries. Unlike several other types of cancer, PCa has few genetic drivers, which has led researchers to look for additional epigenetic and transcriptomic contributors to PCa development and progression. Especially datasets on DNA methylation, the most commonly studied epigenetic marker, have recently been measured and analysed in several PCa patient cohorts. DNA methylation is most commonly associated with downregulation of gene expression. However, positive associations of DNA methylation to gene expression have also been reported, suggesting a more diverse mechanism of epigenetic regulation. Such additional complexity could have important implications for understanding prostate cancer development but has not been studied at a genome-wide scale. In this study, we have compared three sets of genome-wide single-site DNA methylation data from 870 PCa and normal tissue samples with multi-cohort gene expression data from 1117 samples, including 532 samples where DNA methylation and gene expression have been measured on the exact same samples. Genes were classified according to their corresponding methylation and expression profiles. A large group of hypermethylated genes was robustly associated with increased gene expression (UPUP group) in all three methylation datasets. These genes demonstrated distinct patterns of correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression compared to the genes showing the canonical negative association between methylation and expression (UPDOWN group). This indicates a more diversified role of DNA methylation in regulating gene expression than previously appreciated. Moreover, UPUP and UPDOWN genes were associated with different compartments — UPUP genes were related to the structures in nucleus, while UPDOWN genes were linked to extracellular features. We identified a robust association between hypermethylation and upregulation of gene expression when comparing samples from prostate cancer and normal tissue. These results challenge the classical view where DNA methylation is always associated with suppression of gene expression, which underlines the importance of considering corresponding expression data when assessing the downstream regulatory effect of DNA methylation.

--- Paper 5: O-GlcNAc and the Epigenetic Regulation of Gene Expression* ---
O-GlcNAcylation is an abundant nutrient-driven modification linked to cellular signaling and regulation of gene expression. Utilizing precursors derived from metabolic flux, O-GlcNAc functions as a homeostatic regulator. The enzymes of O-GlcNAc cycling, OGT and O-GlcNAcase, act in mitochondria, the cytoplasm, and the nucleus in association with epigenetic “writers” and “erasers” of the histone code. Both O-GlcNAc and O-phosphate modify repeats within the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD). By communicating with the histone and CTD codes, O-GlcNAc cycling provides a link between cellular metabolic status and the epigenetic machinery. Thus, O-GlcNAcylation is poised to influence trans-generational epigenetic inheritance.

The relationship between IL17A and IL17F gene expression and the epigenetic modifications impacting histone acetylation is underscored by the broader understanding of how epigenetic regulation influences gene expression. Histone modifications, particularly acetylation, are critical in the epigenetic landscape, where they can influence the accessibility of transcription factors and RNA polymerases to target genes (A. Piunti, A. Shilatifard, “Epigenetic balance of gene expression by Polycomb and COMPASS families”, Science, 2016). Furthermore, the coupling of epigenetic marks such as O-GlcNAcylation with histone modifications indicates a complex interaction between metabolic signals and gene expression regulation (B. Lewis, J. Hanover, “O-GlcNAc and the Epigenetic Regulation of Gene Expression”, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2014). Additionally, while there is a traditional view correlating DNA methylation with repression of gene expression, recent findings have suggested that hypermethylation may also be associated with upregulation of gene expression, implying a more nuanced regulatory model which may impact IL17A and IL17F expression (Ieva Rauluseviciute, F. Drabløs, M. Rye, “DNA hypermethylation associated with upregulated gene expression in prostate cancer demonstrates the diversity of epigenetic regulation”, BMC Medical Genomics, 2020). These insights suggest potential areas for novel hypothesis generation regarding the specific mechanisms by which histone acetylation might regulate IL17A and IL17F gene expression, particularly in the context of immune responses and inflammatory diseases.

--- Paper 1: The binding activity of Mel‐18 at the Il17a promoter is regulated by the integrated signals of the TCR and polarizing cytokines ---
We have previously shown that in differentiated T‐helper (Th)1 and Th2 cells, polycomb group (PcG) proteins are associated differentially with the promoters of the signature cytokine genes. The correlation of the binding activity of PcG proteins with gene expression is unusual, since they are well known as epigenetic regulators that maintain transcriptional silencing. Here we show that in Th17 cells, the more phenotypically flexible Th lineage, the PcG proteins Mel‐18 and less strikingly Ezh2 are associated differentially with the Il17a promoter. Using the RNAi approach, we found that Mel‐18 and Ezh2 positively regulate the expression of Il17a and Il17f. The inducible binding of Mel‐18 and Ezh2 at the Il17a promoter was dependent on signaling pathways downstream of the TCR. However, a continuous presence of TGF‐β, the cytokine that is necessary to maintain Il17a expression, was required to preserve the binding activity of Mel‐18, but not of Ezh2, following restimulation. The binding of Mel‐18 at the Il17a promoter was correlated with the recruitment of the lineage‐specifying transcription factor RORγt. Altogether, our results suggest that in Th17 cells the TCR and polarizing cytokines synergize to modulate the binding activity of Mel‐18 at the Il17a promoter, and consequently to facilitate Il17a expression.

Interleukin (IL) 17A, IL6 and Stat3 have been described to play crucial roles in chronic liver injury. However, the modulatory effect of MSCs on these markers was controversial in different diseases. BM-MSCs might activate the IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway and promote cell invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma, but the immunomodulatory role of BM-MSCs on IL17A/IL6/STAT3 was not fully elucidated in liver fibrosis. In the present study, we evaluated the capacity of the BM-MSCs in the modulation of cytokines milieu and signal transducers, based on unique inflammatory genes Il17a and Il17f and their receptors Il17rc and their effect on the IL6/STAT3 pathway in CCl4-induced liver fibrosis in rats. A single dose of BM-MSCs was administered to the group with induced liver fibrosis, and the genes and proteins of interest were evaluated along six weeks after treatment. Our results showed a significant downregulation of Il17a, Il17ra, il17f and Il17rc genes. In accordance, BM-MSCs administration declined IL17, IL2 and IL6 serum proteins and downregulated IL17A and IL17RA proteins in liver tissue. Interestingly, BM-MSCs downregulated both Stat3 mRNA expression and p-STAT3, while Stat5a gene was downregulated and p-STAT5 protein was elevated. Also P-SMAD3 and TGFβR2 proteins were downregulated in response to BM-MSCs treatment. Collectively, we suggest that BM-MSCs might play an immunomodulatory role in the treatment of liver fibrosis through downregulation of IL17A affecting IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway.

--- Paper 3: IL17A and IL17F Gene Polymorphism Association with Psoriasis Risk and Response to Treatment in a Polish Population ---
Background: Recent studies have revealed the pivotal role of Th17 cells and interleukin-17 (IL-17) in plaque psoriasis development and treatment outcome. The IL-17 family consists of 6 structurally related cytokines (IL-17A, IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E, IL-17F), of which IL-17A and IL-17F mediate similar biological effects. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate an association between the IL17A (-197G>A; rs2275913) and IL17F (rs763780: T>C; rs11465553: G>A; rs2397084: T>C) polymorphisms with psoriasis susceptibility as well as response to topical and combined topical with narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) therapy in a Polish population. Methods: Association study involving 407 psoriasis patients and 205 healthy controls. Treatment efficacy was analyzed in 207 patients with mild psoriasis (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; PASI 3-12) and moderate psoriasis (PASI 12-18), who were randomly subjected to topical or combined topical and NB-UVB treatment. The polymorphisms were evaluated by RT-PCR. Results: No statistically significant differences between psoriasis patients and controls were found in the frequency of the evaluated IL17A and IL17F genotypes and haplotypes. The IL17A or IL17F polymorphisms were not associated with treatment outcome measures: efficacy of treatment at the eighth week of the study and PASI change after topical or combined topical and NB-UVB therapy. However, IL17F rs2397084 variant allele C carriers required a significantly higher number of NB-UVB irradiations in comparison to TT homozygotes (15.5 ± 11.4 vs. 11.1 ± 11.9, p = 0.047) to produce a positive clinical response. Conclusion: It can be stated that the IL17A and IL17F polymorphisms are not markers of susceptibility to psoriasis. However, the IL17F polymorphism may affect the response to NB-UVB therapy.

--- Paper 4: Association analysis of the interleukin 17 genes IL17A and IL17F as potential osteoarthritis susceptibility loci ---
Primary osteoarthritis (OA) has a major genetic component that is transmitted in a complex, non-mendelian manner. We previously conducted a genome-wide linkage scan on OA affected sibling-pair families and identified several genomic regions potentially harbouring OA risk loci. The strongest evidence was obtained on chromosome 6p12.3–q13, with a multipoint logarithm of the odds score of 4.0.1 This linkage was restricted to the 146 families in our cohort that contained female sibling-pairs concordant for hip OA. A subsequent high density microsatellite linkage scan of the interval provided further strong evidence for linkage as well as evidence of association with several markers, including D6S1956.2 This marker is located less than 200 kb distal of the interleukin 17 (IL17) genes, IL17A and IL17F.

IL17 was originally identified as a product of CD4+ memory T cells, with subsequent studies demonstrating secretion by CD8+ cells.3,4 IL17 is an inducer of several cytokines, …

--- Paper 5: Bioinformatic analyses suggest augmented interleukin-17 signaling as the mechanism of COVID-19-associated herpes zoster ---
Herpes zoster results from latent varicella zoster virus reactivation in the dorsal root ganglia, causing blistering rash along the dermatomal distribution and post-herpetic neuralgia. Increasing studies indicated that there may be a correlation between herpes zoster and COVID-19. Nevertheless, the detailed pathophysiological mechanism is still unclear. We used bioinformatic analyses to study the potential genetic crosstalk between herpes zoster and COVID-19. COVID-19 and herpes zoster were associated with a similar subset of genes involved in “cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction,” “Jak-STAT signaling pathway,” and “IL-17 signaling pathway,” including TNF, IL10, ESR1, INFG, HLA-A, CRP, STAT3, IL6, IL7, and IL17A. Protein-protein interaction network assay showed that the combined gene set indicated a raised connectivity as compared to herpes zoster or COVID-19 alone, particularly the potentiated interactions with APOE, ARSA, CCR2, CCR5, CXCL13, EGFR, GAL, GP2, HLA-B, HLA-DRB1, IL5, TECTA, and THBS1, and these genes are related to “cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction”. Augmented Th17 cell differentiation and the resulting enhanced IL-17 signaling were identified in both COVID-19 and herpes zoster. Our data suggested aberrant interleukin-17 signaling as one possible mechanism through which COVID-19 could raise the risk of herpes zoster.

The relationship between IL17A and IL17F gene expression and the modulation by cytokine signaling pathways presents several key findings. In Th17 cells, the understanding of IL17A expression is linked to TCR and polarizing cytokines that regulate the binding of epigenetic factors such as Mel-18, which subsequently promotes IL17A and IL17F expression (The binding activity of Mel‐18 at the Il17a promoter is regulated by the integrated signals of the TCR and polarizing cytokines by Hod-Dvorai et al., European Journal of Immunology, 2011). Additionally, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have demonstrated the potential to downregulate IL17A expression and its effects on the IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway in liver fibrosis, suggesting a cytokine interplay that affects IL17 genes in diseased states (Bone marrow derived-mesenchymal stem cells downregulate IL17A dependent IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway in CCl4-induced rat liver fibrosis by Farouk et al., PLoS ONE, 2018). However, research remains conflicted regarding polymorphisms in IL17A and IL17F genes and their association with treatment outcomes in conditions like psoriasis, which did not show any significant susceptibility markers in the population studied despite suggesting different responses to therapy based on genetic variants (IL17A and IL17F Gene Polymorphism Association with Psoriasis Risk and Response to Treatment in a Polish Population by Białecka et al., Dermatology, 2016). Collectively, these studies highlight a complex interplay of cytokine signaling affecting IL17A and IL17F expression, suggesting avenues for investigation into their modulatory effects in rheumatological conditions, particularly how different pathways intersect at varied stages of inflammatory responses.

--- Paper 1: Association analysis of the common varieties of IL17A and IL17F genes with the risk of knee osteoarthritis ---
Osteoarthritis is mediated by various types of cytokines, growth factors, and inflammatory factors that the role of the interleukin‐17 family in this disease is becoming increasingly apparent. The aim of this study is to determine the association between the common polymorphisms of IL17A (including rs2275913) and IL17F (including rs2397084 and rs763780) genes with the knee osteoarthritis risk which was followed by a bioinformatics approach. In a case‐control study, 254 participants consisting of 127 healthy individuals and 127 subjects with knee osteoarthritis referring to Shahid Beheshti Hospital dependents on Kashan University of Medical Sciences (Kashan, Iran) were enrolled. After samples collection, the polymorphisms genotyping was determined by the polymerase chain reaction‐restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR‐RFLP) method. Finally, some bioinformatics tools were used to analyze the molecular effects of the three studied polymorphisms. Data analysis showed a significant association between rs2275913‐GA genotype and the decreased risk of knee osteoarthritis (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.33‐0.97, P = .040). However, rs763780‐AG genotype (OR = 2.29, 95%CI = 1.11‐4.69, P = .024) and rs763780‐G allele (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.09‐3.72, P = .026) were associated with an increased risk of knee osteoarthritis. However, no significant associations were found between the rs2397084 polymorphism and knee osteoarthritis risk. Our structural analysis revealed that the rs2275913 polymorphism could create a new binding site for TFII‐I at the promoter region of IL17A. Also, rs2397084 and rs763780 could significantly affect the function and structure of IL17A. Based on our findings, rs2275913 and rs763780 could be considered as protective and risk factors for knee osteoarthritis, respectively. Therefore, these polymorphisms can be considered as biomarkers for the screening of knee osteoarthritis susceptible persons.

--- Paper 2: MicroRNAs 15A and 16-1 Activate Signaling Pathways That Mediate Chemotaxis of Immune Regulatory B cells to Colorectal Tumors. ---
BACKGROUND & AIMS
B cells infiltrate tumors, but little is known about how they affect tumor growth and progression. microRNA15A (MIR15A or miRNA15A) and microRNA16-1 (MIR16-1 or miRNA16-1) regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, and drug resistance. We investigated their involvement in B-cell-mediated immune suppression by colorectal tumors.


METHODS
Mice with disruptions of the gene cluster that encodes MIR15A and MIR16-1 (knockout mice), and control (C57BL/B6) mice were given azoxymethane with dextran sodium sulfate (AD) to induce formation of colorectal tumors. Mice were given anti-CD20 to delete B cells, or injections of agomir to increase MIR15A and MIR16-1. Proliferation of CD8+T cells was measured by carboxyfluorescein-succinimidyl-ester analysis. Colon tissues were collected from mice and analyzed by flow cytometry, microRNA (miRNA) sequencing, and for cytokine production. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) were isolated and transfected with miRNA mimics, to identify their targets. We analyzed miRNA expression patterns and quantified B cells in colorectal cancer tissue microarrays derived from 90 patients who underwent surgical resection, from July 2006 through April 2008, in Shanghai, China; expression data were compared with clinical outcomes.


RESULTS
Tumors that developed in knockout mice following administration of AD were larger and contained greater numbers of B cells than tumors that grew in control mice. Most of the B cells in the tumors were positive for immunoglobulin A (IgA+). IgA+ B cells expressed high levels of immune regulatory molecules (programmed death ligand 1, interleukin 10, and transforming growth factor beta), and repressed the proliferation and activation of CD8+ T cells. Levels of MIR15A and MIR16-1 were reduced in colon tumors from mice, compared with nontumor colon tissue. Incubation of IECs with IL17A reduced expression of MIR15A and MIR16-1. Transgenic expression of MIR15A and MIR16-1 in IECs decreased activation of NF-κB and STAT1 by reducing expression of I-kappaB kinases; this resulted in reduced production of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligands 9 and 10 and decreased chemotaxis of IgA+ B cells. Tumors in mice injected with AD and agomir grew more slowly than tumors in mice not given in agomir and contained fewer IgA+ B cells. We found a negative correlation between levels of MIR15A and MIR16-1 and numbers of IgA+B cells in human colorectal tumor tissues; high levels of MIR15A and MIR16-1 and low numbers of IgA+B cells were associated with longer survival times of patients.


CONCLUSIONS
We found increased levels of MIR15A and MIR16-1 to reduce numbers of IgA+ B cells in colorectal tumor tissues and correlate with increased survival time of patients. In mice that lack MIR15A and MIR16-1, colon tumors grow more rapidly and contain increased numbers of IgA+ B cells. MIR15A and MIR16-1 appear to activate signaling pathways required for B-cell-mediated immune suppression.

--- Paper 3: Generation of Pathogenic Th17 Cells in the Absence of TGF-β Signaling ---
CD4+ T-helper cells that selectively produce interleukin (IL)-17 (TH17), are critical for host defence and autoimmunity. Although crucial for TH17 cells in vivo, IL-23 has been thought to be incapable of driving initial differentiation. Rather, IL-6 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 have been proposed to be the factors responsible for initiating specification. Here we show that TH17 differentiation can occur in the absence of TGF-β signalling. Neither IL-6 nor IL-23 alone efficiently generated TH17 cells; however, these cytokines in combination with IL-1β effectively induced IL-17 production in naive precursors, independently of TGF-β. Epigenetic modification of the Il17a, Il17f and Rorc promoters proceeded without TGF-β1, allowing the generation of cells that co-expressed RORγt (encoded by Rorc) and T-bet. T-bet+RORγt+ TH17 cells are generated in vivo during experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, and adoptively transferred TH17 cells generated with IL-23 without TGF-β1 were pathogenic in this disease model. These data indicate an alternative mode for TH17 differentiation. Consistent with genetic data linking IL23R with autoimmunity, our findings re-emphasize the importance of IL-23 and therefore may have therapeutic implications.

--- Paper 4: Associations between functional polymorphisms in the NFκB signaling pathway and response to anti-TNF treatment in Danish patients with inflammatory bowel disease ---
Antitumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is used for treatment of severe cases of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). However, one-third of the patients do not respond to the treatment. Genetic markers may predict individual response to anti-TNF therapy. Using a candidate gene approach, 39 mainly functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 26 genes regulating inflammation were assessed in 738 prior anti-TNF-naive Danish patients with IBD. The results were analyzed using logistic regression (crude and adjusted for age, gender and smoking status). Nineteen functional polymorphisms that alter the NFκB-mediated inflammatory response (TLR2 (rs3804099, rs11938228, rs1816702, rs4696480), TLR4 (rs5030728, rs1554973), TLR9 (rs187084, rs352139), LY96 (MD-2) (rs11465996), CD14 (rs2569190), MAP3K14 (NIK) (rs7222094)), TNF-α signaling (TNFA (TNF-α) (rs361525), TNFRSF1A (TNFR1) (rs4149570), TNFAIP3(A20) (rs6927172)) and other cytokines regulated by NFκB (IL1B (rs4848306), IL1RN (rs4251961), IL6 (rs10499563), IL17A (rs2275913), IFNG (rs2430561)) were associated with response to anti-TNF therapy among patients with CD, UC or both CD and UC (P⩽0.05). In conclusion, the results suggest that polymorphisms in genes involved in activating NFκB through the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways, genes regulating TNF-α signaling and cytokines regulated by NFκB are important predictors for the response to anti-TNF therapy among patients with IBD. Genetically strong TNF-mediated inflammatory response was associated with beneficial response. In addition, the cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and IFN-γ may be potential targets for treating patients with IBD who do not respond to anti-TNF therapy. These findings should be examined in independent cohorts before these results are applied in a clinical setting.

--- Paper 5: Involvement of IL17A, IL17F and IL23R Polymorphisms in Colorectal Cancer Therapy ---
IL23/IL17 pathway plays an important role in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In general, the genes encoding the cytokines are genetically polymorphic and polymorphisms in genes IL23R and IL17 have been proved to be associated with its susceptibility to inflammatory diseases as well as cancer including colorectal cancer. Moreover, it has been shown that these interleukins are involved in anti-tumor or pro-tumor effects of various cancers. Previously, we showed that there is a significant association between IL17A, IL17F and IL23R polymorphisms as well as the occurrence of colorectal cancer and the clinical features of the disease. The purpose of the present work is to investigate an association between IL17A, IL17F and IL23R polymorphisms in 102 Tunisian patients with colorectal cancer treatment. The association was analyzed by statistical tools. We found that patients with mutated genotypes of IL17A G197A SNP could be a risk factor for the inefficiency of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Unlike IL17F variant, patients with wild type genotypes require surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. On the one hand, we found no evidence that supports a significant association between IL23R polymorphism and the combined genotypes of these three genes and the colorectal cancer treatment. On the other hand, we showed that there is an important interaction between IL17A/IL17F polymorphisms and the stage of the disease as well as its treatment. Finally, patients with IL17F wild type genotype highlighted that there is a valid longer OS without all treatments and with radiotherapy and a neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In contrast, we observed that there are no relationships between IL17A, IL23R and the survival of these patients neither with nor without the treatment. Our results suggest that polymorphisms in IL17A and IL17F genes may be a predictive source of colorectal cancer therapy type. Therefore, IL17F may serve as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer.

The role of IL17A and IL17F genes in the context of cytokine signaling pathways in rheumatologic conditions is increasingly recognized. For instance, genetic polymorphisms in IL17A have been correlated with both susceptibility to knee osteoarthritis and response to anti-TNF treatment in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), indicating that variations in cytokine signaling significantly influence disease outcomes (Association analysis of the common varieties of IL17A and IL17F genes with the risk of knee osteoarthritis; Associations between functional polymorphisms in the NFκB signaling pathway and response to anti-TNF treatment in Danish patients with inflammatory bowel disease). Additionally, the interplay between IL17A and IL17F polymorphisms and clinical outcomes in colorectal cancer suggests these interleukins may also modulate treatment responses, further implying a complex role of cytokine signaling in disease management (Involvement of IL17A, IL17F and IL23R Polymorphisms in Colorectal Cancer Therapy). 

However, a notable gap remains in clearly delineating the mechanisms by which these cytokines interact with various signaling pathways, particularly in autoimmune conditions. Specifically, while evidence links IL17A and IL17F to inflammatory responses, the precise roles and regulatory networks involving IL17F remain less defined compared to IL17A, highlighting a potential area for further investigation (Generation of Pathogenic Th17 Cells in the Absence of TGF-β Signaling). Collectively, these findings suggest that exploring the interplay among IL17A, IL17F, and cytokine signaling pathways may yield new insights into the pathogenesis of rheumatologic diseases.

--- Paper 1: IL17A critically shapes the transcriptional program of fibroblasts in pancreatic cancer and switches on their protumorigenic functions ---
Significance There are controversial data about the protumoral role of pancreatic cancer stroma, and dissecting multiple aspects will help to develop effective tailored therapies. Interleukin-17A (IL17A) has been reported to accelerate pancreatic acinar–ductal metaplasia, be important for maintaining stem-like cancer cells, and recruit immunosuppressive granulocytes into the tumor. Here we unveil a relationship between IL17A and pancreatic stromal cells, which strongly modifies their gene and protein expression profiles. Ablation of IL17A, in fact, modifies the cytokines/factors released by tumor fibroblasts by limiting T cell immunosuppression. IL17A inhibition may represent an important tool for designing novel combined therapeutic approaches. A hallmark of cancer, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), is a massive stromal and inflammatory reaction. Many efforts have been made to identify the anti- or protumoral role of cytokines and immune subpopulations within the stroma. Here, we investigated the role of interleukin-17A (IL17A) and its effect on tumor fibroblasts and the tumor microenvironment. We used a spontaneous PDA mouse model (KPC) crossed to IL17A knockout mice to show an extensive desmoplastic reaction, without impaired immune infiltration. Macrophages, especially CD80+ and T cells, were more abundant at the earlier time point. In T cells, a decrease in FoxP3+ cells and an increase in CD8+ T cells were observed in KPC/IL17A−/− mice. Fibroblasts isolated from IL17A+/+ and IL17A−/− KPC mice revealed very different messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein profiles. IL17A−/− fibroblasts displayed the ability to restrain tumor cell invasion by producing factors involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, increasing T cell recruitment, and producing higher levels of cytokines and chemokines favoring T helper 1 cell recruitment and activation and lower levels of those recruiting myeloid/granulocytic immune cells. Single-cell quantitative PCR on isolated fibroblasts confirmed a very divergent profile of IL17A-proficient and -deficient cells. All these features can be ascribed to increased levels of IL17F observed in the sera of IL17A−/− mice, and to the higher expression of its cognate receptor (IL17RC) specifically in IL17A−/− cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). In addition to the known effects on neoplastic cell transformation, the IL17 cytokine family uniquely affects fibroblasts, representing a suitable candidate target for combinatorial immune-based therapies in PDA.

--- Paper 2: The Prosurvival IKK-Related Kinase IKKε Integrates LPS and IL17A Signaling Cascades to Promote Wnt-Dependent Tumor Development in the Intestine. ---
Constitutive Wnt signaling promotes intestinal cell proliferation, but signals from the tumor microenvironment are also required to support cancer development. The role that signaling proteins play to establish a tumor microenvironment has not been extensively studied. Therefore, we assessed the role of the proinflammatory Ikk-related kinase Ikkε in Wnt-driven tumor development. We found that Ikkε was activated in intestinal tumors forming upon loss of the tumor suppressor Apc Genetic ablation of Ikkε in β-catenin-driven models of intestinal cancer reduced tumor incidence and consequently extended survival. Mechanistically, we attributed the tumor-promoting effects of Ikkε to limited TNF-dependent apoptosis in transformed intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, Ikkε was also required for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IL17A-induced activation of Akt, Mek1/2, Erk1/2, and Msk1. Accordingly, genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and anti-microbial peptides were downregulated in Ikkε-deficient tissues, subsequently affecting the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages and IL17A synthesis. Further studies revealed that IL17A synergized with commensal bacteria to trigger Ikkε phosphorylation in transformed intestinal epithelial cells, establishing a positive feedback loop to support tumor development. Therefore, TNF, LPS, and IL17A-dependent signaling pathways converge on Ikkε to promote cell survival and to establish an inflammatory tumor microenvironment in the intestine upon constitutive Wnt activation.

--- Paper 3: Cytokine polymorphisms are associated with poor sleep maintenance in adults living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. ---
STUDY OBJECTIVES
Cytokine activity and polymorphisms have been associated with sleep outcomes in prior animal and human research. The purpose of this study was to determine whether circulating plasma cytokines and cytokine polymorphisms are associated with the poor sleep maintenance commonly experienced by adults living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS).


DESIGN
Cross-sectional descriptive study.


SETTING
HIV clinics and community sites in the San Francisco Bay area.


PARTICIPANTS
A convenience sample of 289 adults (193 men, 73 women, and 23 transgender) living with HIV/AIDS.


INTERVENTIONS
None.


MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS
A wrist actigraph was worn for 72 h to estimate the percentage of wake after sleep onset (WASO%) and total sleep time (TST), plasma cytokines were analyzed, and genotyping was conducted for 15 candidate genes involved in cytokine signaling: interferon-gamma (IFNG), IFNG receptor 1 (IFNGR1), interleukins (IL1B, IL1R2, IL1R2, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL13, IL17A), nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells (NFKB1 and NFKB2), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA). Controlling for demographic variables such as race and sex, and clinical variables such as CD4+ count and medications, higher WASO% was associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL1R2 rs11674595 and TNFA rs1041981 and less WASO% was associated with IL2 rs2069776. IL1R2 rs11674595 and TNFA rs1041981 were also associated with short sleep duration.


CONCLUSIONS
This study strengthens the evidence for an association between inflammation and sleep maintenance problems. In this chronic illness population, cytokine polymorphisms associated with wake after sleep onset provide direction for intervention research aimed at comparing anti-inflammatory mechanisms with hypnotic agents for improving sleep maintenance and total sleep time.

--- Paper 4: Role of the IL23/IL17 Pathway in Crohn’s Disease ---
Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing disorder of the gastrointestinal tract and represents one of the main entities of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). CD affects genetically susceptible patients that are influenced by environmental factors and the intestinal microbiome, which results in excessive activation of the mucosal immune system and aberrant cytokine responses. Various studies have implicated the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL17 and IL23 in the pathogenesis of CD. IL23 is a member of the IL12 family of cytokines and is able to enhance and affect the expansion of pathogenic T helper type 17 (Th17) cells through various mechanisms, including maintenance of Th17 signature genes, upregulation of effector genes or suppression of repressive factors. Moreover, IL17 and IL23 signaling is able to induce a cascade of pro-inflammatory molecules like TNF, IFNγ, IL22, lymphotoxin, IL1β and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Here, IL17A and TNF are known to mediate signaling synergistically to drive expression of inflammatory genes. Recent advances in understanding the immunopathogenetic mechanisms underlying CD have led to the development of new biological therapies that selectively intervene and inhibit inflammatory processes caused by pro-inflammatory mediators like IL17 and IL23. Recently published data demonstrate that treatment with selective IL23 inhibitors lead to markedly high response rates in the cohort of CD patients that failed previous anti-TNF therapy. Macrophages are considered as a main source of IL23 in the intestine and are supposed to play a key role in the molecular crosstalk with T cell subsets and innate lymphoid cells in the gut. The following review focuses on mechanisms, pathways and specific therapies in Crohn’s disease underlying the IL23/IL17 pathway.

--- Paper 5: Jagged-1 signaling suppresses the IL-6 and TGF-β treatment-induced Th17 cell differentiation via the reduction of RORγt/IL-17A/IL-17F/IL-23a/IL-12rb1 ---
Jagged-1 signaling has recently been reported to be involved in the Th17 cell differentiation. However, little is known about its mechanisms. Soluble Jagged-1 was used to activate the Jagged-1–Notch signaling to interfere with the IL-6 and TGF-β-induced Th17 cell skewing. Genes relevant to the autoimmunity or inflammation were screened for the first time in this system by qPCR array for the differential expressions. The 18 genes out of 84, including Clec7a, Il12b, Il12rb1, Il12rb2, Csf3, Il15, Il17a, Il17f, Il17rc, Il17rd, Il17re, Il23a, Myd88, Socs1, Stat4, Stat5a, Sykb and Tbx21, were downregulated, but only Cxcl2, Cxcl12 and Mmp3 were upregulated. The expressions of the genes, Rorγt, Il17a, Il17f, Il12rb1 and Il23a, induced by simultaneous IL-6 and TGF-β treatment were significantly suppressed by Jagged-1, followed by the reduction of RORγt, IL-17A and IL-17F. Consistent with the attenuation of RORγt and the reduced production and secretion of IL-17A and IL-17F in the cell supernatant and the in situ stained cells, the number of CD4+IL-17+ cells was also diminished. It is concluded that the Jagged-1–Notch signaling can suppress the IL-6 and TGF-β treatment-induced Th17 cell skewing through the attenuation of RORγt and, hence by, the down-regulation of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-23a and IL-12rb1.

The expression of IL17A and IL17F is intricately regulated by several cytokine signaling pathways, particularly those associated with inflammatory responses in various disease contexts, including rheumatologic conditions. IL17A has been shown to enhance the tumor microenvironment by influencing the expression of several cytokines, revealing its role in shaping immune cell recruitment and function, particularly in the context of pancreatic cancer (IL17A critically shapes the transcriptional program of fibroblasts in pancreatic cancer and switches on their protumorigenic functions). Additionally, IL17A signaling intersects with the activation of other inflammatory pathways, such as IKKε signaling cascades, which promote tumor development by maintaining cell survival and inflammatory conditions (The Prosurvival IKK-Related Kinase IKKε Integrates LPS and IL17A Signaling Cascades to Promote Wnt-Dependent Tumor Development in the Intestine). There is an observed modulation of gene expression related to IL17 signaling in pathogenic conditions like Crohn’s disease, where the IL23/IL17 pathway is notably involved in amplifying inflammatory responses, leading to further expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Role of the IL23/IL17 Pathway in Crohn’s Disease). These findings suggest potential avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting IL17A and IL17F in rheumatologic conditions and highlight an interplay between cytokine signaling that may inform future research configurations (Cytokine polymorphisms are associated with poor sleep maintenance in adults living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; Jagged-1 signaling suppresses the IL-6 and TGF-β treatment-induced Th17 cell differentiation via the reduction of RORγt/IL-17A/IL-17F/IL-23a/IL-12rb1).

--- Paper 1: Transcriptional regulation of innate lymphoid cell fate ---
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a recently described family of lymphoid effector cells that have important roles in immune defence, inflammation and tissue remodelling. It has been proposed that ILCs represent 'innate' homologues of differentiated effector T cells, and they have been categorized into three groups — namely, ILC1s, ILC2s and ILC3s — on the basis of their expression of cytokines and transcription factors that are typically associated with T helper 1 (TH1)-, TH2- and TH17-type immune responses, respectively. Indeed, remarkable similarity is seen between the specific transcription factors required for the development and diversification of different ILC groups and those that drive effector T cell differentiation. The recent identification of dedicated ILC precursors has provided a view of the mechanisms that control this first essential stage of ILC development. Here, we discuss the transcriptional mechanisms that regulate ILC development and diversification into distinct effector subsets with key roles in immunity and tissue homeostasis. We further caution against the current distinction between 'helper' versus 'killer' subsets in the evolving area of ILC nomenclature.

--- Paper 2: Th9 cells: differentiation and disease ---
CD4+ T‐helper cells regulate immunity and inflammation through the acquisition of potential to secrete specific cytokines. The acquisition of cytokine‐secreting potential, in a process termed T‐helper cell differentiation, is a response to multiple environmental signals including the cytokine milieu. The most recently defined subset of T‐helper cells are termed Th9 and are identified by the potent production of interleukin‐9 (IL‐9). Given the pleiotropic functions of IL‐9, Th9 cells might be involved in pathogen immunity and immune‐mediated disease. In this review, I focus on recent developments in understanding the signals that promote Th9 differentiation, the transcription factors that regulate IL‐9 expression, and finally the potential roles for Th9 cells in immunity in vivo.

--- Paper 3: Complex interactions of transcription factors in mediating cytokine biology in T cells ---
T‐helper (Th) cells play critical roles within the mammalian immune system, and the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into distinct T‐helper subsets is critical for normal immunoregulation and host defense. These carefully regulated differentiation processes are controlled by networks of cytokines, transcription factors, and epigenetic modifications, resulting in the generation of multiple CD4+ T‐cell subsets, including Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, Treg, and Tfh cells. In this review, we discuss the roles of transcription factors in determining the specific type of differentiation and in particular the role of interleukin‐2 (IL‐2) in promoting or inhibiting Th differentiation. In addition to discussing master regulators and subset‐specific transcription factors for distinct T‐helper cell populations, we focus on signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins and on the cooperative action of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) with activator protein 1 (AP‐1) family proteins and STAT3 in the assembly of complexes that broadly influence T‐cell differentiation.

--- Paper 4: T Helper Cell Differentiation, Heterogeneity, and Plasticity. ---
Naïve CD4 T cells, on activation, differentiate into distinct T helper (Th) subsets that produce lineage-specific cytokines. By producing unique sets of cytokines, effector Th subsets play critical roles in orchestrating immune responses to a variety of infections and are involved in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases including autoimmunity, allergy, and asthma. The differentiation of Th cells relies on the strength of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and signals triggered by polarizing cytokines that activate and/or up-regulate particular transcription factors. Several lineage-specific master transcription factors dictate Th cell fates and functions. Although these master regulators cross-regulate each other, their expression can be dynamic. Sometimes, they are even coexpressed, resulting in massive Th-cell heterogeneity and plasticity. Similar regulation mediated by these master regulators is also found in innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that are innate counterparts of Th cells.

--- Paper 5: Helper T‐cell differentiation and plasticity: insights from epigenetics ---
CD4+ T cells have critical roles in orchestrating immune responses to diverse microbial pathogens. This is accomplished through the differentiation of CD4+ T helper cells to specialized subsets in response to microbial pathogens, which evoke a distinct cytokine milieu. Signal transducer and activator of transcription family transcription factors sense these cytokines and they in turn regulate expression of lineage‐defining master regulators that programme selective gene expression, resulting in distinctive phenotypes. However, phenotype and restricted gene expression are determined not only by the action of transcription factors; chromatin accessibility is required for these factors to exert their effect. Technical advances have greatly expanded our understanding of transcription factor action and dynamic changes in the epigenome that accompany cellular differentiation. In this review, we will discuss recent progress in the understanding of how cytokines influence gene expression and epigenetic modifications, and the impact of these findings on our views of helper cell lineage commitment and plasticity.

Transcription factors play a pivotal role in the differentiation of immune cells, particularly T-helper cells and innate lymphoid cells, with significant implications for rheumatologic conditions. Studies show that the acquisition of cytokine-secreting potential during T-helper differentiation is influenced by environmental cues, including cytokines, and regulated by specific transcription factors (Kaplan, M. (2013). Th9 cells: differentiation and disease. Immunological Reviews). Transcription factors such as STAT proteins and master regulators are crucial in mediating the differentiation processes, dynamically responding to cytokine signals (Li, P. et al. (2014). Complex interactions of transcription factors in mediating cytokine biology in T cells. Immunological Reviews). Moreover, the interplay between these transcription factors and cytokine signaling pathways appears to drive the heterogeneity and plasticity of immune responses, which is particularly relevant in the context of autoimmune diseases (Zhu, J. (2018). T Helper Cell Differentiation, Heterogeneity, and Plasticity. Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology). However, while the functional roles of transcription factors in immune differentiation are becoming clearer, there are still gaps regarding the specific mechanisms by which these interactions influence the pathogenesis of rheumatologic conditions, suggesting a need for further investigation into their regulatory networks (Hirahara, K. et al. (2011). Helper T‐cell differentiation and plasticity: insights from epigenetics. Immunology).

--- Paper 1: Molecular mechanisms regulating Th1 immune responses. ---
The T helper lymphocyte is responsible for orchestrating the appropriate immune response to a wide variety of pathogens. The recognition of the polarized T helper cell subsets Th1 and Th2 has led to an understanding of the role of these cells in coordinating a variety of immune responses, both in responses to pathogens and in autoimmune and allergic disease. Here, we discuss the mechanisms that control lineage commitment to the Th1 phenotype. What has recently emerged is a rich understanding of the cytokines, receptors, signal transduction pathways, and transcription factors involved in Th1 differentiation. Although the picture is still incomplete, the basic pathways leading to Th1 differentiation can now be understood in in vitro and a number of infection and disease models.

--- Paper 2: Type I IFN Induces Binding of STAT1 to Bcl6: Divergent Roles of STAT Family Transcription Factors in the T Follicular Helper Cell Genetic Program ---
CD4+ T follicular helper cells (TFH) are critical for the formation and function of B cell responses to infection or immunization, but also play an important role in autoimmunity. The factors that contribute to the differentiation of this helper cell subset are incompletely understood, although several cytokines including IL-6, IL-21, and IL-12 can promote TFH cell formation. Yet, none of these factors, nor their downstream cognate STATs, have emerged as nonredundant, essential drivers of TFH cells. This suggests a model in which multiple factors can contribute to the phenotypic characteristics of TFH cells. Because type I IFNs are often generated in immune responses, we set out to investigate whether these factors are relevant to TFH cell differentiation. Type I IFNs promote Th1 responses, thus one possibility was these factors antagonized TFH-expressed genes. However, we show that type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) induced B cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl6) expression, the master regulator transcription factor for TFH cells, and CXCR5 and programmed cell death-1 (encoded by Pdcd1), key surface molecules expressed by TFH cells. In contrast, type I IFNs failed to induce IL-21, the signature cytokine for TFH cells. The induction of Bcl6 was regulated directly by STAT1, which bound to the Bcl6, Cxcr5, and Pdcd1 loci. These data suggest that type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) and STAT1 can contribute to some features of TFH cells but are inadequate in inducing complete programming of this subset.

--- Paper 3: CD4+T Cells: Differentiation and Functions ---
CD4+T cells are crucial in achieving a regulated effective immune response to pathogens. Naive CD4+T cells are activated after interaction with antigen-MHC complex and differentiate into specific subtypes depending mainly on the cytokine milieu of the microenvironment. Besides the classical T-helper 1 and T-helper 2, other subsets have been identified, including T-helper 17, regulatory T cell, follicular helper T cell, and T-helper 9, each with a characteristic cytokine profile. For a particular phenotype to be differentiated, a set of cytokine signaling pathways coupled with activation of lineage-specific transcription factors and epigenetic modifications at appropriate genes are required. The effector functions of these cells are mediated by the cytokines secreted by the differentiated cells. This paper will focus on the cytokine-signaling and the network of transcription factors responsible for the differentiation of naive CD4+T cells.

--- Paper 4: IL-17 and Th17 Cells. ---
CD4+ T cells, upon activation and expansion, develop into different T helper cell subsets with different cytokine profiles and distinct effector functions. Until recently, T cells were divided into Th1 or Th2 cells, depending on the cytokines they produce. A third subset of IL-17-producing effector T helper cells, called Th17 cells, has now been discovered and characterized. Here, we summarize the current information on the differentiation and effector functions of the Th17 lineage. Th17 cells produce IL-17, IL-17F, and IL-22, thereby inducing a massive tissue reaction owing to the broad distribution of the IL-17 and IL-22 receptors. Th17 cells also secrete IL-21 to communicate with the cells of the immune system. The differentiation factors (TGF-beta plus IL-6 or IL-21), the growth and stabilization factor (IL-23), and the transcription factors (STAT3, RORgammat, and RORalpha) involved in the development of Th17 cells have just been identified. The participation of TGF-beta in the differentiation of Th17 cells places the Th17 lineage in close relationship with CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), as TGF-beta also induces differentiation of naive T cells into Foxp3+ Tregs in the peripheral immune compartment. The investigation of the differentiation, effector function, and regulation of Th17 cells has opened up a new framework for understanding T cell differentiation. Furthermore, we now appreciate the importance of Th17 cells in clearing pathogens during host defense reactions and in inducing tissue inflammation in autoimmune disease.

--- Paper 5: The JAK-STAT pathway: impact on human disease and therapeutic intervention. ---
The Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer of activators of transcription (STAT) pathway is now recognized as an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway employed by diverse cytokines, interferons, growth factors, and related molecules. This pathway provides an elegant and remarkably straightforward mechanism whereby extracellular factors control gene expression. It thus serves as a fundamental paradigm for how cells sense environmental cues and interpret these signals to regulate cell growth and differentiation. Genetic mutations and polymorphisms are functionally relevant to a variety of human diseases, especially cancer and immune-related conditions. The clinical relevance of the pathway has been confirmed by the emergence of a new class of therapeutics that targets JAKs.

Transcription factors play a critical role in the differentiation of immune cells, which is intricately linked with various cytokine signaling pathways, particularly in the context of rheumatologic conditions. Notably, the T helper cell differentiation—especially into Th1 and Th17 lineages—highlights how specific cytokines influence the expression of transcription factors. For instance, the cytokine milieu containing TGF-beta, IL-6, and IL-21 is essential for the differentiation of Th17 cells, regulated by transcription factors such as STAT3 (IL-17 and Th17 Cells) and RORgammat (IL-17 and Th17 Cells). Additionally, the involvement of type I interferons (IFNs) in promoting Th1 responses while also influencing Bcl6 expression in TFH cells reflects the complexity of cytokine-transcription factor interactions (Type I IFN Induces Binding of STAT1 to Bcl6: Divergent Roles of STAT Family Transcription Factors in the T Follicular Helper Cell Genetic Program). 

Moreover, the JAK-STAT pathway serves as a vital signaling mechanism for multiple cytokines that ultimately dictate gene expression and immune cell differentiation, indicating a potential target for therapeutic interventions in autoimmune diseases (The JAK-STAT pathway: impact on human disease and therapeutic intervention). Research gaps remain in fully elucidating the non-redundant roles of various transcription factors in the context of diverse cytokines, suggesting that further exploration could yield novel hypotheses on how to manipulate these pathways for therapeutic benefit in rheumatologic conditions.

--- Paper 1: Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes: Applications in Regenerative Medicine ---
Exosomes are a type of extracellular vesicles, produced within multivesicular bodies, that are then released into the extracellular space through a merging of the multivesicular body with the plasma membrane. These vesicles are secreted by almost all cell types to aid in a vast array of cellular functions, including intercellular communication, cell differentiation and proliferation, angiogenesis, stress response, and immune signaling. This ability to contribute to several distinct processes is due to the complexity of exosomes, as they carry a multitude of signaling moieties, including proteins, lipids, cell surface receptors, enzymes, cytokines, transcription factors, and nucleic acids. The favorable biological properties of exosomes including biocompatibility, stability, low toxicity, and proficient exchange of molecular cargos make exosomes prime candidates for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Exploring the functions and molecular payloads of exosomes can facilitate tissue regeneration therapies and provide mechanistic insight into paracrine modulation of cellular activities. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of exosome biogenesis, composition, and isolation methods. We also discuss emerging healing properties of exosomes and exosomal cargos, such as microRNAs, in brain injuries, cardiovascular disease, and COVID-19 amongst others. Overall, this review highlights the burgeoning roles and potential applications of exosomes in regenerative medicine.

--- Paper 2: Interpretation of cytokine signaling through the transcription factors STAT5A and STAT5B. ---
Transcription factors from the family of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT) are activated by numerous cytokines. Two members of this family, STAT5A and STAT5B (collectively called STAT5), have gained prominence in that they are activated by a wide variety of cytokines such as interleukins, erythropoietin, growth hormone, and prolactin. Furthermore, constitutive STAT5 activation is observed in the majority of leukemias and many solid tumors. Inactivation studies in mice as well as human mutations have provided insight into many of STAT5's functions. Disruption of cytokine signaling through STAT5 results in a variety of cell-specific effects, ranging from a defective immune system and impaired erythropoiesis, the complete absence of mammary development during pregnancy, to aberrant liver function. On a molecular level, STAT5 has been linked to cell specification, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Evidence is growing that the diverse outcomes of STAT5 signaling are not only determined by the expression of specific receptors but also by the interaction of STAT5 with cofactors and the cell-specific activity of members of the SOCS family, which negatively regulate STAT function. In this review, we focus on emerging concepts and challenges in the field of Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT5 signaling. First, we discuss unique functions of STAT5 in three distinct systems: mammary epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and regulatory T cells. Second, we present an example of how STAT5 can achieve cell specificity in hepatocytes through a physical and functional interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor. Third, we focus on the relevance of STAT5 in the development and progression of leukemia. Next, we discuss lessons derived from human mutations and disease. Finally, we address an emerging issue that the interpretation of experiments from STAT5-deficient mice and cells might be compromised as these cells might reroute and reprogram cytokine signals to the "wrong" STATs and thus acquire inappropriate cues. We propose that mice with mutations in various components of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway are living laboratories, which will provide insight into the versatility of signaling hardware and the adaptability of the software.

--- Paper 3: T‐cell metabolism governing activation, proliferation and differentiation; a modular view ---
T lymphocytes are a critical component of the adaptive immune system mediating protection against infection and malignancy, but also implicated in many immune pathologies. Upon recognition of specific antigens T cells clonally expand, traffic to inflamed sites and acquire effector functions, such as the capacity to kill infected and malignantly transformed cells and secrete cytokines to coordinate the immune response. These processes have significant bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands, which are met by dynamic changes in T‐cell metabolism, specifically increases in glucose uptake and metabolism; mitochondrial function; amino acid uptake, and cholesterol and lipid synthesis. These metabolic changes are coordinate by key cellular kinases and transcription factors. Dysregulated T‐cell metabolism is associated with impaired immunity in chronic infection and cancer and conversely with excessive T‐cell activity in autoimmune and inflammatory pathologies. Here we review the key aspects of T‐cell metabolism relevant to their immune function, and discuss evidence for the potential to therapeutically modulate T‐cell metabolism in disease.

--- Paper 4: KLF2 in Regulation of NF-κB-Mediated Immune Cell Function and Inflammation ---
KLF2 (Kruppel-like factor 2) is a member of the zinc finger transcription factor family, which critically regulates embryonic lung development, function of endothelial cells and maintenance of quiescence in T-cells and monocytes. It is expressed in naïve T-cells and monocytes, however its level of expression decreases during activation and differentiation. KLF2 also plays critical regulatory role in various inflammatory diseases and their pathogenesis. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) is an important inducer of inflammation and the inflammation is mediated through the transcription of several proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules. So, both transcriptional factors KLF2 and NF-κB are being associated with the similar cellular functions and their maintenance. It was shown that KLF2 regulates most of the NF-κB-mediated activities. In this review, we focused on emphasizing the involvement of KLF2 in health and disease states and how they interact with transcriptional master regulator NF-κB.

--- Paper 5: Peripheral CD4+ T‐cell differentiation regulated by networks of cytokines and transcription factors ---
Summary:  CD4+ T cells, also known as T‐helper (Th) cells, play an important role in orchestrating adaptive immune responses to various infectious agents. They are also involved in the induction of autoimmune and allergic diseases. Upon T‐cell receptor (TCR)‐mediated cell activation, naive CD4+ T cells can differentiate into at least four major lineages, Th1, Th2, Th17, and iTreg cells, that participate in different types of immune responses. Networks of cytokines and transcription factors are critical for determining CD4+ T‐cell fates and effector cytokine production. Here, we review collaboration and cross‐regulation between various essential cytokines in the activation/induction of key transcription factors during the process of Th cell differentiation towards these distinct lineages. We also discuss the interactions of key transcription factors at both genetic and protein levels and the function of the resulting network(s) in regulating the expression of effector cytokines.

Cytokines and transcription factors play crucial roles in immune cell differentiation, and their interplay is particularly relevant in the context of rheumatologic conditions. For instance, CD4+ T cells differentiate into various lineages, such as Th1 and Th17, influenced by networks of cytokines and transcription factors, which are critical for determining T-cell fates (Peripheral CD4+ T‐cell differentiation regulated by networks of cytokines and transcription factors, Jinfang Zhu, W.

Transcription factors, particularly members of the STAT family like STAT5, are activated by a range of cytokines and are essential for immune functions, further illustrating the intersection of transcriptional regulation and cytokine signaling in immune responses (Interpretation of cytokine signaling through the transcription factors STAT5A and STAT5B, L. Hennighausen, G. Robinson, Genes & Development, 2008). Moreover, the transcription factor KLF2 is involved in regulating inflammation and interacts with NF-κB, a significant modulator of cytokine expression, indicating a complex regulatory network in immune responses (KLF2 in Regulation of NF-κB-Mediated Immune Cell Function and Inflammation, Prerana Jha, H.

However, gaps remain in fully understanding how these transcription factors specifically drive differentiation in pathological contexts like autoimmune diseases, highlighting the need for further exploration of these pathways (T‐cell metabolism governing activation, proliferation and differentiation; a modular view, S.

--- Paper 1: The Role of NF-κB in Physiological Bone Development and Inflammatory Bone Diseases: Is NF-κB Inhibition “Killing Two Birds with One Stone”? ---
Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of various genes involved in inflammation and the immune response. The activation of NF-κB occurs via two pathways: inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β, activate the “classical pathway”, and cytokines involved in lymph node formation, such as CD40L, activate the “alternative pathway”. NF-κB1 (p50) and NF-κB2 (p52) double-knockout mice exhibited severe osteopetrosis due to the total lack of osteoclasts, suggesting that NF-κB activation is required for osteoclast differentiation. These results indicate that NF-κB may be a therapeutic target for inflammatory bone diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal disease. On the other hand, mice that express the dominant negative form of IκB kinase (IKK)-β specifically in osteoblasts exhibited increased bone mass, but there was no change in osteoclast numbers. Therefore, inhibition of NF-κB is thought to promote bone formation. Taken together, the inhibition of NF-κB leads to “killing two birds with one stone”: it suppresses bone resorption and promotes bone formation. This review describes the role of NF-κB in physiological bone metabolism, pathologic bone destruction, and bone regeneration.

--- Paper 2: β-Sitosterol-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles ameliorate complete Freund’s adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats: involvement of NF-кB and HO-1/Nrf-2 pathway ---
Abstract Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), autoimmune disease that is categorized via chronic inflammation manifestation, obesity, cardiovascular risk and even enhanced the mortality and affect the 0.3 and 1% of population worldwide. The current experimental study was scrutinize the anti-arthritic effect of β-sitosterol loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) against complete Fruend adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritis via dual pathway. Double emulsion solvent displacement method was used for the preparation of β-sitosterol solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN). CFA was used to induce arthritis and rats were divided into different groups for 28 days. Biochemical, anti-inflammatory, pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediator were estimated, respectively. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2), Heme Oxygenase-1(HO-1) and Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) expression were estimated. β-sitosterol-SLN significantly (p < .001) reduced the paw edema, arthritic index and increased the body weight. β-sitosterol-SLN increased the redox status of synovium {reduce the malonaldehyde (MDA) and increase superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT)} level and reduced the cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-2, interleukin-6, interleukin-16, interleukin-17 and increased level of interleukin-10, Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). β-sitosterol-SLN significantly (p < .001) reduced the level of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and NF-κB. β-sitosterol-SLN significantly increased the expression of HO-1,Nrf2 and decreased the expression of NF-κB, RANKL, STAT3. In conclusion, β-sitosterol SLN showed the antiarthritic effect via suppression of NF-kB and activation of HO-1/Nrf-2 pathway.

--- Paper 3: Total saponin from Anemone flaccida Fr. Schmidt abrogates osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption via the inhibition of RANKL-induced NF-κB, JNK and p38 MAPKs activation ---
Osteoclasts, bone-specialized multinucleated cells, are responsible for bone destructive diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis. Natural plant-derived products have received substantial attention given their potential therapeutic and preventive activities against bone destructive diseases. In the present study, we investigated the effects of total saponin (TS) from Anemone flaccida Fr. Schmidt, on receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced in vitro osteoclast differentiation. We observed that TS concentration-dependently inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast formation from RAW 264.7 cell and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), as well as decreased extent of actin ring formation and lacunar resorption. The RANKL-stimulated expression of osteoclast-related transcription factors were also diminished by TS. Moreover, TS blocked the RANKL-triggered TRAF6 expression, phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and IκB-α, and inhibited NF-κB p65 DNA binding activity. Furthermore, TS almost abrogated the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc1) and c-Fos expression. Taken together, our results demonstrated that TS suppresses RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and inflammatory bone loss via the down-regulation of TRAF6 level, suppression of JNK and p38 MAPKs and NF-κB activation, and subsequent decreased expression of c-Fos and NFATc1. Therefore, TS may be a potential agent and needs to be more evaluated in vivo or in clinical trials to become a therapeutic for lytic bone diseases.

--- Paper 4: NF-κB-direct activation of microRNAs with repressive effects on monocyte-specific genes is critical for osteoclast differentiation ---
BackgroundMonocyte-to-osteoclast conversion is a unique terminal differentiation process that is exacerbated in rheumatoid arthritis and bone metastasis. The mechanisms implicated in upregulating osteoclast-specific genes involve transcription factors, epigenetic regulators and microRNAs (miRNAs). It is less well known how downregulation of osteoclast-inappropriate genes is achieved.ResultsIn this study, analysis of miRNA expression changes in osteoclast differentiation from human primary monocytes revealed the rapid upregulation of two miRNA clusters, miR-212/132 and miR-99b/let-7e/125a. We demonstrate that they negatively target monocyte-specific and immunomodulatory genes like TNFAIP3, IGF1R and IL15. Depletion of these miRNAs inhibits osteoclast differentiation and upregulates their targets. These miRNAs are also upregulated in other inflammatory monocytic differentiation processes. Most importantly, we demonstrate for the first time the direct involvement of Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-κB) in the regulation of these miRNAs, as well as with their targets, whereby NF-κB p65 binds the promoters of these two miRNA clusters and NF-κB inhibition or depletion results in impaired upregulation of their expression.ConclusionsOur results reveal the direct involvement of NF-κB in shutting down certain monocyte-specific genes, including some anti-inflammatory activities, through a miRNA-dependent mechanism for proper osteoclast differentiation.

--- Paper 5: Interleukin 26 Skews Macrophage Polarization Towards M1 Phenotype by Activating cJUN and the NF-κB Pathway ---
Interleukin 26 (IL-26) is a new member of the IL-10 family that is highly expressed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the functions of IL-26 produced by macrophages in RA have not been elucidated. In the present work, we evaluated the effects and the mechanisms of IL-26 on M1 and M2 macrophage differentiation. Human or mouse macrophage cells were treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS), interferon gamma (IFNγ), or IL-4 alone or concurrently treated with IL-26 to monitor M1 or M2 macrophage subtypes. The expression level of M1 or M2 macrophage genes was evaluated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The molecular mechanisms of downstream signaling activation during differentiation were investigated by immunoblotting assay. Our results found that IL-26 promoted macrophage cells from CD80+ M1 macrophage differentiation, not from the CD206+ M2 phenotype. The messenger RNA of M1-type macrophage markers tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was up-regulated in the IL-26-treated group. Also, the M1-related proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6 were induced after IL-26 stimulation. Interestingly, IL-10, a cytokine marker of M2 macrophage, was also elevated after IL-26 stimulation. Moreover, the M1-like macrophage stimulated by IL-26 underwent cJUN, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) activation. Our findings suggested the role of IL-26 in synovial macrophages of active rheumatoid arthritis and provided a new insight into IL-26 as a candidate therapeutic target in rheumatoid arthritis.

Transcription factors, particularly NF-κB, play a crucial role in immune cell differentiation and inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis. The activation of NF-κB is necessary for osteoclast differentiation, highlighting its importance in inflammatory bone diseases (The Role of NF-κB in Physiological Bone Development and Inflammatory Bone Diseases: Is NF-κB Inhibition “Killing Two Birds with One Stone?”). Furthermore, the inhibition of NF-κB leads to decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and can ameliorate arthritic conditions, as shown by the anti-arthritic effects of β-sitosterol via NF-κB suppression (β-Sitosterol-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles ameliorate complete Freund’s adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats: involvement of NF-кB and HO-1/Nrf-2 pathway). Additionally, NF-κB directly regulates microRNAs that target genes specific to monocyte-derived osteoclasts, suggesting a complex interplay where NF-κB not only activates inflammatory pathways but also modulates gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms (NF-κB-direct activation of microRNAs with repressive effects on monocyte-specific genes is critical for osteoclast differentiation). These findings suggest potential therapeutic strategies involving NF-κB modulation to address chronic inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, emphasizing the need for further investigation into NF-κB's dual role in gene regulation and immune cell differentiation.

--- Paper 1: NF-κB signaling in rheumatoid arthritis with focus on fibroblast-like synoviocytes ---
The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway regulates multiple processes in innate and adaptive immune cells. This pathway is involved in inflammation through the regulation of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules expression. The NF-κB transcription factor also participates in the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of cells. Therefore, deregulated NF-κB activation contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is classified as a heterogeneous and complex autoimmune inflammatory disease. Although different immune and non-immune cells contribute to the RA pathogenesis, fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) play a crucial role in disease progression. These cells are altered during the disease and produce inflammatory mediators, including inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases, which result in joint and cartilage erosion. Among different cell signaling pathways, it seems that deregulated NF-κB activation is associated with the inflammatory picture of RA. NF-κB activation can also promote the proliferation of RA-FLSs as well as the inhibition of FLS apoptosis that results in hyperplasia in RA synovium. In this review, the role of NF-κB transcription factor in immune and non-immune cells (especially FLSs) that are involved in RA pathogenesis are discussed.

--- Paper 2: Molecular Interactions between NR4A Orphan Nuclear Receptors and NF-κB Are Required for Appropriate Inflammatory Responses and Immune Cell Homeostasis ---
Appropriate innate and adaptive immune responses are essential for protection and resolution against chemical, physical or biological insults. Immune cell polarization is fundamental in orchestrating distinct phases of inflammation, specifically acute phase responses followed by resolution and tissue repair. Dysregulation of immune cell and inflammatory responses is a hallmark of multiple diseases encompassing atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and metabolic syndromes. A master transcriptional mediator of diverse inflammatory signaling and immune cell function is NF-κB, and altered control of this key regulator can lead to an effective switch from acute to chronic inflammatory responses. Members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors crosstalk with NF-κB to regulate immune cell function(s). Within the NR superfamily the NR4A1-3 orphan receptors have emerged as important regulators of immune cell polarization and NF-κB signaling. NR4A receptors modulate NF-κB activity in a dynamic fashion, either repressing or enhancing target gene expression leading to altered inflammatory outcome. Here we will discuss the pivotal role NR4A’s receptors play in orchestrating immune cell homeostasis through molecular crosstalk with NF-κB. Specifically, we will examine such NR4A/NF-κB interactions within the context of distinct cell phenotypes, including monocyte, macrophage, T cells, endothelial, and mesenchymal cells, which play a role in inflammation-associated disease. Finally, we review the therapeutic potential of altering NR4A/NF-κB interactions to limit hyper-inflammatory responses in vivo.

--- Paper 3: Combination of NF-kB targeted siRNA and methotrexate in a hybrid nanocarrier towards the effective treatment in rheumatoid arthritis ---
BackgroundThe transcription factor NF-kB plays an important role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Effective treatment of RA is hindered due to the lack of specificity of small molecules in the inflamed joints. In this study, we aimed to develop a unique hybrid-nanoparticles system comprised of calcium phosphate/liposome to deliver NF-kB-targeted siRNA and methotrexate (MTX) to diseased site.ResultsWe have successfully demonstrated that the combination of siRNA and MTX in a calcium phosphate/liposome-based hybrid nanocarrier could effectively treat the RA. We have showed that folate receptor-targeted nanocarrier system significantly suppression the arthritis progression in mice model. Substantial accumulation of F-siRML was observed in LPS-activated macrophages. These kind of activated macrophages are generally present in the RA and osteoarthritis and folate-targeted nanoparticle enables the effective accumulation of therapeutics in the diseased site. The combinational nanoparticles effectively blocked the NF-kB signaling pathways and reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, siRML and F-siRML did not show any decrease in the lymphocyte count indicating that it can avoid the adverse effect of MTX.ConclusionTherefore, siRML and F-siRML provides unique benefits of excellent therapeutic efficacy with excellent safety profile in the arthritic mice and could be an promising approach in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

--- Paper 4: Redox-sensitive transcription factors play a significant role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis ---
ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease which is associated with significant morbidity. Redox sensitive transcription factors including NF-κB, HIF, AP-1, and Nrf2 are intimately involved in the pathogenesis of RA. The treatment of this disease is limited by the elusive nature of the pathogenesis of RA. NF-κB is crucial for the maturation of immune cells as well as production of TNFα and MMPs, which escalate RA. HIF is essential for activation of inflammatory cells, angiogenesis and pannus formation in RA. AP-1 regulates cytokine and MMP production as well as synovial hyperplasia which are key processes in RA. Nrf2 is involved with chondrogenesis, osteoblastogenesis, prostaglandin secretion and ROS production in RA. Targeting two or more of these transcription factors may result in increased efficacy than either therapy in isolation. This review will highlight the control specific mediators on these transcription factors, the subsequent effect of these transcription factors once activated, and then mesh this with the pathogenesis of RA. The elucidation of key transcription factor regulation in the pathogenesis of RA may highlight the novel therapy interventions which may prove to have a greater efficacy than those therapies currently available.

--- Paper 5: Non-canonical NF-κB signaling in rheumatoid arthritis: Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde? ---
The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) family of transcription factors is essential for the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but can also induce regulatory pathways. NF-κB can be activated via two distinct pathways: the classical or canonical pathway, and the alternative or non-canonical pathway. It is well established that the canonical NF-κB pathway is essential both in acute inflammatory responses and in chronic inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although less extensively studied, the non-canonical NF-κB pathway is not only central in lymphoid organ development and adaptive immune responses, but is also thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of RA. Importantly, this pathway appears to have cell type-specific functions and, since many different cell types are involved in the pathogenesis of RA, it is difficult to predict the net overall contribution of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway to synovial inflammation. In this review, we describe the current understanding of non-canonical NF-κB signaling in various important cell types in the context of RA and consider the relevance to the pathogenesis of the disease. In addition, we discuss current drugs targeting this pathway, as well as future therapeutic prospects.

The role of transcription factors, particularly NF-κB, is pivotal in the immune cell differentiation and inflammation observed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). NF-κB not only regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines but also influences the survival and proliferation of immune cells involved in RA pathogenesis (Leila Nejatbakhsh Samimi et al., "NF-κB signaling in rheumatoid arthritis with focus on fibroblast-like synoviocytes," Autoimmunity Highlights, 2020). Furthermore, nuclear receptor superfamily members, such as the NR4A receptors, interact with NF-κB to modulate immune responses dynamically, thereby impacting inflammation outcomes (E. Murphy and D. Crean, "Molecular Interactions between NR4A Orphan Nuclear Receptors and NF-κB Are Required for Appropriate Inflammatory Responses and Immune Cell Homeostasis," Biomolecules, 2015). Additionally, the non-canonical NF-κB pathway has been highlighted as having distinct roles across different cell types within the joint environment, suggesting a complex interplay that could be therapeutically targeted (A. Noort et al., "Non-canonical NF-κB signaling in rheumatoid arthritis: Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde?" Arthritis Research & Therapy, 2015). These findings underscore a potential area of research to further investigate how differential regulation of NF-κB-related transcription factors might lead to shifts between acute and chronic inflammatory states in RA, thereby contributing to disease progression.

--- Paper 1: NF-κB Signaling and Inflammation—Drug Repurposing to Treat Inflammatory Disorders? ---
Simple Summary Since its first description 35 years ago, the transcription factor NF-κB (nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) has been shown to be a key mediator of immune cell responses to inflammatory mediators, oxidative stress and genotoxic injury. Dysregulated NF-κB signalling drives inflammation in inflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, re-establishing the appropriate regulation of NF-κB activity seems like a promising approach to treat inflammatory diseases. Current anti-inflammatory drugs have many, often serious, side effects. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need for safe and effective anti-inflammatory medicines that both decrease inflammatory mediator production and enhance endogenous anti-inflammatory and prorepair pathways. So far, traditional de novo drug discovery has fallen short of satisfying this need. Drug repurposing is a cost- and time-effective alternative to de novo drug development for the identification of novel applications and has already resulted in the identification of effective anti-inflammatories in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper we critically review NF-κB as a potential target for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs with an emphasis on drug repurposing as a strategy to identify new approaches to treat inflammatory diseases. Abstract NF-κB is a central mediator of inflammation, response to DNA damage and oxidative stress. As a result of its central role in so many important cellular processes, NF-κB dysregulation has been implicated in the pathology of important human diseases. NF-κB activation causes inappropriate inflammatory responses in diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Thus, modulation of NF-κB signaling is being widely investigated as an approach to treat chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmunity and cancer. The emergence of COVID-19 in late 2019, the subsequent pandemic and the huge clinical burden of patients with life-threatening SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia led to a massive scramble to repurpose existing medicines to treat lung inflammation in a wide range of healthcare systems. These efforts continue and have proven to be controversial. Drug repurposing strategies are a promising alternative to de novo drug development, as they minimize drug development timelines and reduce the risk of failure due to unexpected side effects. Different experimental approaches have been applied to identify existing medicines which inhibit NF-κB that could be repurposed as anti-inflammatory drugs.

--- Paper 2: Role of Signal Transduction Pathways and Transcription Factors in Cartilage and Joint Diseases ---
Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are common cartilage and joint diseases that globally affect more than 200 million and 20 million people, respectively. Several transcription factors have been implicated in the onset and progression of osteoarthritis, including Runx2, C/EBPβ, HIF2α, Sox4, and Sox11. Interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) leads to osteoarthritis through NF-ĸB, IκBζ, and the Zn2+-ZIP8-MTF1 axis. IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) play a major pathological role in rheumatoid arthritis through NF-ĸB and JAK/STAT pathways. Indeed, inhibitory reagents for IL-1, IL-6, and TNFα provide clinical benefits for rheumatoid arthritis patients. Several growth factors, such as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), and Indian hedgehog, play roles in regulating chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. Disruption and excess of these signaling pathways cause genetic disorders in cartilage and skeletal tissues. Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive, an autosomal genetic disorder characterized by ectopic ossification, is induced by mutant ACVR1. Mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) inhibitors can prevent ectopic ossification induced by ACVR1 mutations. C-type natriuretic peptide is currently the most promising therapy for achondroplasia and related autosomal genetic diseases that manifest severe dwarfism. In these ways, investigation of cartilage and chondrocyte diseases at molecular and cellular levels has enlightened the development of effective therapies. Thus, identification of signaling pathways and transcription factors implicated in these diseases is important.

--- Paper 3: Inflammation, NF-κB, and Chronic Diseases: How are They Linked? ---
Most chronic diseases, caused by lifestyle factors, appear to be linked to inflammation. Inflammation is activated mechanistically, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a significant mediator. NF-κB, one of the most studied transcription factors, was first identified in the nucleus of B lymphocytes almost three decades ago. This protein has a key function in regulating the human immune system, and its dysregulation has been linked to many chronic diseases including asthma, cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation, and neurological disorders. Physiologically, many cytokines have been discovered that activate NF-κB. Pathologically, environmental carcinogens such as cigarette smoke, radiation, bacteria, and viruses can also activate this transcription factor. NF-κB activation controls expression of more than 500 genes, and most are deleterious to the human body when dysregulated. More than 70,000 articles have been published regarding NF-κB. This review emphasizes the upside and downside of NF-κB in normal and disease conditions and the ways in which we can control this critical transcription factor in patients.

--- Paper 4: Baicalin alleviates collagen-induced arthritis and suppresses TLR2/MYD88/NF-κB p65 signaling in rats and HFLS-RAs ---
Baicalin is a flavonoid isolated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiapoptotic pharmacological properties. However, the therapeutic effect of baicalin on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is not completely understood. The present study aimed to explore the therapeutic potential and mechanisms underlying baicalin in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model rats. CIA was induced in male SD rats. The hind paw thickness and severity of joint injury were monitored to assess the onset of arthritis. At 28 days after the initial immunization, different doses of baicalin were administered once daily via oral gavage for 40 days. The radiologic and pathological alterations were examined using X-ray, and hematoxylin and eosin staining, respectively. ELISA was employed to measure the serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting were conducted to determine the expression of toll-like receptor (TLR)2, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88) and NF-κB p65. Baicalin treatment noticeably alleviated radiographic and histologic abnormalities in the hind paw joints of CIA model rats in a dose-dependent manner. The serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased in baicalin-treated CIA model rats compared with vehicle-treated CIA model rats. The mRNA expression levels of TLR2 and MYD88, as well as the protein expression levels of TLR2, MYD88 and NF-κB p65 were significantly decreased by baicalin treatment in the synovial tissue of CIA model rats and human RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes. The results suggested that baicalin may exert a beneficial effect on CIA, which may be mediated by inhibiting the TLR2/MYD88/NF-κB signaling pathway.

--- Paper 5: Mechanisms of NF-κB p65 and strategies for therapeutic manipulation ---
The transcription factor NF-κB is a critical regulator of immune and inflammatory responses. In mammals, the NF-κB/Rel family comprises five members: p50, p52, p65 (Rel-A), c-Rel, and Rel-B proteins, which form homo- or heterodimers and remain as an inactive complex with the inhibitory molecules called IκB proteins in resting cells. Two distinct NF-κB signaling pathways have been described: 1) the canonical pathway primarily activated by pathogens and inflammatory mediators, and 2) the noncanonical pathway mostly activated by developmental cues. The most abundant form of NF-κB activated by pathologic stimuli via the canonical pathway is the p65:p50 heterodimer. Disproportionate increase in activated p65 and subsequent transactivation of effector molecules is integral to the pathogenesis of many chronic diseases such as the rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, and even neurodegenerative pathologies. Hence, the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway has been a pivotal point for intense drug discovery and development. This review begins with an overview of p65-mediated signaling followed by discussion of strategies that directly target NF-κB p65 in the context of chronic inflammation.

The NF-κB signaling pathway plays a critical role in the regulation of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, primarily mediated by transcription factors that influence immune cell differentiation. The dysregulation of NF-κB is associated with inappropriate inflammatory responses in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (Roberti et al., NF-κB Signaling and Inflammation—Drug Repurposing to Treat Inflammatory Disorders?). Various transcription factors, including those involved in IL-1β signaling, activate NF-κB, emphasizing the interconnectedness of immune responses and the inflammatory process (Nishimura et al., Role of Signal Transduction Pathways and Transcription Factors in Cartilage and Joint Diseases). The specific contribution of NF-κB p65, known for its role in transactivation, underscores its importance in chronic inflammation and potential as a therapeutic target (Giridharan & Srinivasan, Mechanisms of NF-κB p65 and strategies for therapeutic manipulation). 

Research gaps exist regarding the precise pathways through which transcription factors regulate NF-κB activity in immune cells, suggesting that further investigation into these interactions could reveal novel therapeutic avenues (Kunnumakkara et al., Inflammation, NF-κB, and Chronic Diseases: How are They Linked?). In particular, exploring the effects of pharmacological agents like baicalin, which inhibit TLR2/MYD88/NF-κB signaling, could provide insights into managing rheumatoid arthritis and its linked inflammatory mechanisms (Bai et al., Baicalin alleviates collagen-induced arthritis and suppresses TLR2/MYD88/NF-κB p65 signaling in rats and HFLS-RAs). Overall, these findings highlight the complex regulatory networks of transcription factors and NF-κB in the context of immune cell differentiation and inflammation.

-----------------
-----------------
-----------------
-----------------
The expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in synovial fibroblasts plays a crucial role in the degradation of cartilage extracellular matrix, particularly in conditions such as osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). CX3CL1 has been shown to promote MMP-3 production in osteoarthritis synovial fibroblasts through specific signaling pathways, including c-Raf, MEK, ERK, and NF-κB, highlighting its contribution to cartilage destruction (CX3CL1 promotes MMP-3 production via the CX3CR1, c-Raf, MEK, ERK, and NF-κB signaling pathway in osteoarthritis synovial fibroblasts). Similarly, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) up-regulates MMP-1 and MMP-3 in RA synovial fibroblasts, suggesting MIF is another key player in the catabolic processes leading to cartilage degradation (Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor Up-regulates Expression of Matrix Metalloproteinases in Synovial Fibroblasts of Rheumatoid Arthritis). However, the regulation of MMP expression appears to be complex, as melatonin has been found to inhibit inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β, which may indirectly reduce MMP-mediated cartilage degradation (Melatonin attenuates TNF-α and IL‐1β expression in synovial fibroblasts and diminishes cartilage degradation: Implications for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis). These findings underscore a potential therapeutic avenue where targeting MMP expression directly or indirectly through inflammatory pathways may mitigate cartilage degradation in joint diseases. Further research could elucidate the specific signaling interactions and the therapeutic potential of modulating MMP expression in joint pathologies (Cartilage degradation and invasion by rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts is inhibited by gene transfer of a cell surface-targeted plasmin inhibitor).

--- Paper 1: Soya-cerebroside reduces IL-1β-induced MMP-1 production in chondrocytes and inhibits cartilage degradation: implications for the treatment of osteoarthritis ---
ABSTRACT Osteoarthritis (OA) commonly affects the synovial joint and is characterized by degradation of articular cartilage, which is largely mobilized by increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. Soya-cerebroside, an extract of Cordyceps militaris, inhibits inflammatory cytokine production and monocyte migration in human synovial fibroblasts, although its effects are uncertain on MMP expression in chondrocytes and cartilage degradation. In this study, soya-cerebroside antagonized interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β)-induced MMP-1 production in chondrocytes, without cytotoxic effects. Functional genomic data confirm high levels of MMP-1 expression in OA tissue compared with normal tissue. Soya-cerebroside reduced MMP-1 expression via the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and AP-1 signalling pathways. In addition, soya-cerebroside suppressed IL-1β-promoted MMP-1 expression and cartilage degradation in animal models. Our report is the first to reveal that soya-cerebroside reduces MMP-1 production in chondrocytes and protects cartilage degradation through the FAK, MEK, ERK, and AP-1 signalling cascade.

--- Paper 2: Rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts differentiate into distinct subsets in the presence of cytokines and cartilage ---
BackgroundWe investigated two distinct synovial fibroblast populations that were located preferentially in the lining or sub-lining layers and defined by their expression of either podoplanin (PDPN) or CD248, and explored their ability to undergo self-assembly and transmigration in vivo.MethodsSynovial fibroblasts (SF) were cultured in vitro and phenotypic changes following stimulation with interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 were examined. To examine the phenotype of SF in vivo, a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) human-mouse model of cartilage destruction was utilised.ResultsSF in the lining layer in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) expressed high levels of PDPN compared to the normal synovium, whereas CD248 expression was restricted to sub-lining layer cells. TNF-α or IL1 stimulation in vitro resulted in an increased expression of PDPN. In contrast, stimulation with TGF-β1 induced CD248 expression. In the SCID human-mouse model, rheumatoid SF recapitulated the expression of PDPN and CD248. Fibroblasts adjacent to cartilage expressed PDPN, and attached to, invaded, and degraded cartilage. PDPN+ CD248– SF preceded the appearance of PDPN– CD248+ cells in contralateral implants.ConclusionsWe have identified two distinct SF populations identified by expression of either PDPN or CD248 which are located within different anatomical compartments of the inflamed synovial membrane. These markers discriminate between SF subsets with distinct biological properties. As PDPN-expressing cells are associated with early fibroblast migration and cartilage erosion in vivo, we propose that PDPN-expressing cells may be an attractive therapeutic target in RA.

--- Paper 3: Macrophage migration inhibitory factor: a mediator of matrix metalloproteinase-2 production in rheumatoid arthritis ---
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by destruction of bone and cartilage, which is mediated, in part, by synovial fibroblasts. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a large family of proteolytic enzymes responsible for matrix degradation. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a cytokine that induces the production of a large number of proinflammatory molecules and has an important role in the pathogenesis of RA by promoting inflammation and angiogenesis.In the present study, we determined the role of MIF in RA synovial fibroblast MMP production and the underlying signaling mechanisms. We found that MIF induces RA synovial fibroblast MMP-2 expression in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner. To elucidate the role of MIF in MMP-2 production, we produced zymosan-induced arthritis (ZIA) in MIF gene-deficient and wild-type mice. We found that MMP-2 protein levels were significantly decreased in MIF gene-deficient compared with wild-type mice joint homogenates. The expression of MMP-2 in ZIA was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC revealed that MMP-2 is highly expressed in wild-type compared with MIF gene-deficient mice ZIA joints. Interestingly, synovial lining cells, endothelial cells, and sublining nonlymphoid mononuclear cells expressed MMP-2 in the ZIA synovium. Consistent with these results, in methylated BSA (mBSA) antigen-induced arthritis (AIA), a model of RA, enhanced MMP-2 expression was also observed in wild-type compared with MIF gene-deficient mice joints. To elucidate the signaling mechanisms in MIF-induced MMP-2 upregulation, RA synovial fibroblasts were stimulated with MIF in the presence of signaling inhibitors. We found that MIF-induced RA synovial fibroblast MMP-2 upregulation required the protein kinase C (PKC), c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and Src signaling pathways. We studied the expression of MMP-2 in the presence of PKC isoform-specific inhibitors and found that the PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin inhibits MIF-induced RA synovial fibroblast MMP-2 production. Consistent with these results, MIF induced phosphorylation of JNK, PKCδ, and c-jun. These results indicate a potential novel role for MIF in tissue destruction in RA.

--- Paper 4: Suppression of fibroblast metalloproteinases by ajulemic acid, a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid acid ---
Production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in joint tissue of patients with inflammatory arthritis facilitates cartilage degradation and bone erosion, and leads to joint deformities and crippling. Thus, MMPs are important targets for agents designed to treat inflammatory arthritis. Oral administration of ajulemic acid (AjA), a synthetic, nonpsychoactive cannabinoid acid, prevents joint tissue injury in rats with adjuvant arthritis. AjA binds to and activates PPARγ directly. Therefore, we investigated the influence of AjA on MMP production in human fibroblast‐like synovial cells (FLS), and examined the role of PPARγ in the mechanism of action of AjA. FLS, treated or not with a PPARγ antagonist, were treated with AjA then stimulated with TNFα or IL‐1α. Release of MMPs‐1, 3, and 9 was measured by ELISA. The influence of AjA on MMP‐3 release from stimulated PPARγ positive (PPAR+/−) and PPARγ null (PPAR−/−) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) was also examined. Addition of AjA to FLS suppressed production of MMPs whether or not PPARγ activation was blocked. Secretion of MMP‐3 was also suppressed by AjA in both TNFα‐ and IL‐1α‐stimulated PPARγ+/− and PPARγ−/− MEF. Suppression of MMP secretion from FLS by AjA appears to be PPARγ independent. Prevention by AjA of joint tissue injury and crippling in the rat adjuvant arthritis model may be explained in large part by inhibition of MMPs. These results suggest that AjA may be useful for treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. J. Cell. Biochem. 100: 184–190, 2007. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

--- Paper 5: Endogenous MMP-9 and not MMP-2 promotes rheumatoid synovial fibroblast survival, inflammation and cartilage degradation. ---
OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of endogenous matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9) on the invasive characteristics of RA synovial fibroblasts.


METHODS
Synovial fibroblasts isolated from patients with RA or OA were treated with MMP small interfering RNA (siRNA), inhibitors and recombinant proteins or TNF-α, with or without cartilage explants. Cell viability and proliferation were measured by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) proliferation assays, respectively; apoptosis by an in situ cell death detection kit; migration and invasion by CytoSelect invasion assay, scratch migration and collagen gel assays; cartilage degradation by 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue assay; and inflammatory mediators and MMPs by ELISA, western blot and zymography.


RESULTS
MMP-2 was expressed by both OA and RA synovial fibroblasts, whereas only RA synovial fibroblasts expressed MMP-9. Suppressing MMP-2 or MMP-9 reduced RA synovial fibroblast proliferation equally. However, MMP-9 siRNA had greater effects compared with MMP-2 siRNA on promoting apoptosis and suppressing RA synovial fibroblast viability, migration and invasion. Suppression/inhibition of MMP-9 also decreased the production of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α, inactivated nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and suppressed RA synovial fibroblast-mediated cartilage degradation. In contrast, suppression/inhibition of MMP-2 stimulated TNF-α and IL-17 secretion and activated NF-κB, while recombinant MMP-2 (rMMP-2) inactivated NF-κB and suppressed RA synovial fibroblast-mediated cartilage degradation. Results using specific inhibitors and rMMPs provided supportive evidence for the siRNA results.


CONCLUSION
Endogenous MMP-2 or MMP-9 contribute to RA synovial fibroblast survival, proliferation, migration and invasion, with MMP-9 having more potent effects. Additionally, MMP-9 stimulates RA synovial fibroblast-mediated inflammation and degradation of cartilage, whereas MMP-2 inhibits these parameters. Overall, our data indicate that MMP-9 derived from RA synovial fibroblasts may directly contribute to joint destruction in RA.

The expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in synovial fibroblasts plays a significant role in the degradation of cartilage extracellular matrix, particularly in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). For instance, it has been demonstrated that MIF (macrophage migration inhibitory factor) stimulates RA synovial fibroblasts to produce MMP-2 in a concentration-dependent manner, contributing to tissue destruction (Macrophage migration inhibitory factor: a mediator of matrix metalloproteinase-2 production in rheumatoid arthritis). Additionally, MMP-9, which is exclusively expressed in RA fibroblasts, significantly promotes inflammation and cartilage degradation through various inflammatory mediators, indicating its crucial role in joint destruction (Endogenous MMP-9 and not MMP-2 promotes rheumatoid synovial fibroblast survival, inflammation and cartilage degradation). Conversely, findings suggest that MMP-2 may have an inhibitory effect on inflammation and cartilage degradation, creating a complex balance (Endogenous MMP-9 and not MMP-2 promotes rheumatoid synovial fibroblast survival, inflammation and cartilage degradation). 

There is a consensus that MMPs facilitate cartilage degradation, yet the differential roles of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in RA highlight a potential area for further exploration regarding their signaling pathways and interactions, particularly concerning therapeutic approaches targeting MMP expression (Rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts differentiate into distinct subsets in the presence of cytokines and cartilage). Research indicates that understanding the inhibition of MMP production, such as through the action of agents like ajulemic acid, could offer new avenues for treating joint degeneration (Suppression of fibroblast metalloproteinases by ajulemic acid, a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid acid).

--- Paper 1: Expression of TNF-α, VEGF, and MMP-3 mRNAs in synovial tissues and their roles in fibroblast-mediated osteogenesis in ankylosing spondylitis. ---
The aim of this study was to explore the mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), vessel endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) in synovial tissues in ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and to analyze the functions of these proteins in the differentiation of AS synovial tissue fibroblasts into osteoblasts (OB) and osteoclasts. Synovial tissue samples from 22 AS patients and 22 normal individuals were collected. In situ hybridization was utilized to detect TNF-α, VEGF, and MMP-3 transcripts. After counting numbers of positive cells, Spearman analysis was used to determine the correlation between transcriptional levels of the three mRNAs and the AS disease activity index (BASDAI) and the C-response protein (CRP) levels. With the addition of TNF-α, VEGF, or both factors into cultured normal synovial fibroblasts, osteocalcin (bone gla protein, BGP) secretion levels were compared. We found that expression of TNF-α, VEGF, and MMP-3 was identified exclusively in the disease group. mRNA levels were significantly positively correlated with BASDAI (r = 0.42, 0.38, and 0.47, respectively; P < 0.05) and CRP (r = 0.44, 0.34, and 0.47 respectively; P < 0.05) scores. The secretion level of BGP in normal synovial fibroblasts increased progressively with increasing concentrations of VEGF or TNF-α (P < 0.01 compared to levels before treatment). Furthermore, co-incubation using both VEGF and TNF-α significantly elevated BGP levels compared to the single addition of VEGF or TNF-α (P < 0.01). These results suggest TNF-α, VEGF, and MMP-3 might directly participate in the differentiation of fibroblasts into OBs.

--- Paper 2: miR-let-7c-5p and miR-149-5p inhibit proinflammatory cytokine production in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts ---
Osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are two of the most common types of arthritis. Both are characterized by the infiltration of a number of proinflammatory cytokines into the joint microenvironment. miRNAs play critical roles in the disease processes of arthritic disorders. However, little is known about the effects of miRNAs on critical inflammatory cytokine production with OA and RA progression. Here, we found higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in human OA and RA synovial fibroblasts (SFs) compared with normal SFs. Searches of open-source microRNA (miRNA) software determined that miR-let-7c-5p and miR-149-5p interfere with IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α transcription; levels of all three proinflammatory cytokines were lower in human OA and RA patients compared with normal controls. Anti-inflammatory agents dexamethasone, celecoxib and indomethacin reduced proinflammatory cytokine production by promoting the expression of miR-let-7c-5p and miR-149-5p. Similarly, ibuprofen and methotrexate also enhanced miR-let-7c-5p and miR-149-5p expression in human SFs. The evidence suggests that increasing miR-let-7c-5p and miR-149-5p expression is a novel strategy for OA and RA.

--- Paper 3: Cordycepin inhibits IL-1beta-induced MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts. ---
OBJECTIVE
MMP is a key enzyme in the degradation of extracellular matrices, and its expression plays important roles in inflammatory diseases. Cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine), a bioactive compound of Cordyceps militaris, has been shown to exhibit many pharmacological activities, such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and anti-infection activities. In this study, we aimed at the inhibitory effect of cordycepin on IL-1beta-induced MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression as well as the molecular basis using RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs).


METHODS
RASFs were isolated from synovial tissue obtained from 12 patients with RA and cultured in monolayer. Expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 was evaluated using western blotting and real-time PCR. Chemokines were analysed by ELISA. The phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase was measured by western blotting. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed to evaluate binding activities of DNA to nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1).


RESULTS
Cordycepin inhibited IL-1beta-induced MMP-1 and MMP-3 expressions in RASFs in a dose-dependent manner. Among various chemokines [such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), GRO-alpha, regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES) and epithelial neutrophil activating peptide 78 (ENA-78)], cordycepin specifically blocked IL-1beta-induced ENA-78 production in RASF. Moreover, cordycepin significantly inhibited IL-1beta-induced p38/JNK and AP-1 activation, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and NF-kappaB activation.


CONCLUSIONS
Cordycepin is a potent inhibitor of IL-1beta-induced chemokine production and MMP expression and strongly blocks the p38/JNK/AP-1 signalling pathway in RASFs.

--- Paper 4: Up-regulation by tumor necrosis factor alpha of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression and function in synovial fibroblasts and its inhibition by glucocorticoids. ---
OBJECTIVE
To examine the regulation of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) gene in cultured human synovial fibroblasts in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and investigate its modulation by the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone.


METHODS
Cell surface expression of ICAM-1 was determined by flow cytometry, enzyme immunoassay, and immunoprecipitation. ICAM-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were monitored by Northern blot. ICAM-1 function was determined by measuring the adhesion of monocytes to synovial fibroblasts.


RESULTS
ICAM-1 expression on unstimulated cells was weak but was rapidly enhanced in both a time- and dose-dependent manner following exposure to TNF alpha. Treatment of the cells with TNF alpha also resulted in both a time- and dose-dependent increase in steady-state ICAM-1 mRNA levels, as determined by Northern blot. The increased expression of ICAM-1 was inhibited by cycloheximide and actinomycin D. Cultured synovial fibroblasts from patients with rheumatoid and nonrheumatoid arthropathies responded similarly to TNF alpha. Adhesion studies demonstrated that ICAM-1 is involved in the adherence of peripheral blood monocytes to TNF alpha-activated synovial fibroblasts. In addition, dexamethasone inhibited TNF alpha-induced surface expression of ICAM-1, accumulation of ICAM-1 mRNA, and adhesion of monocytes to TNF alpha-activated synovial fibroblasts.


CONCLUSION
These combined results provide further evidence of an important role of ICAM-1 in inflammatory synovitis, as well as a potentially novel site of antiinflammatory action of glucocorticoids.

--- Paper 5: Resistin enhances IL‐1β and TNF‐α expression in human osteoarthritis synovial fibroblasts by inhibiting miR‐149 expression via the MEK and ERK pathways ---
Resistin is a cysteine‐rich adipokine that promotes the release of inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin 1 beta (IL‐1β) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF‐α), which are critical pro‐inflammatory mediators in osteoarthritis (OA) pathogenesis. We describe evidence of significantly higher levels of resistin, IL‐1β, and TNF‐α expression in OA knee synovial tissue compared with that from non‐OA knees. Resistin‐induced enhancement of IL‐1β and TNF‐α expression in human OA synovial fibroblasts (OASFs) were attenuated by MEK and ERK inhibitors, as well as their respective siRNAs. Our data reveal that resistin enhances the expression of TNF‐α and IL‐1β in OASFs by inhibiting miR‐149 expression via MEK and ERK signaling. Our findings elucidate the inter‐relationships between resistin and pro‐inflammatory mediators during OA pathogenesis and could help to facilitate the development of synovium‐targeted therapy in OA.

For instance, in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts, IL-1beta was found to enhance the expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 in a dose-dependent manner (Noh et al., 2008, Rheumatology). Additionally, pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-alpha were associated with increased levels of MMP-3 and correlated positively with disease activity indicators (Liu et al., 2015, Genetics and Molecular Research). Resistin further complicates this relationship by promoting the expression of both IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in osteoarthritis synovial fibroblasts, which could subsequently lead to increased MMP production (Chen et al., 2020, The FASEB Journal). 

However, while the role of these cytokines in upregulating MMP expression is well-established, the precise signaling pathways, particularly those involving miRNAs such as miR-149 in regulating these interactions, remain underexplored (Law et al., 2021, Aging). Overall, the consensus highlights the critical role of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in the modulation of MMP expression, indicating that targeting these pathways could provide novel therapeutic avenues in inflammatory joint diseases.

--- Paper 1: CD11c+ macrophages and levels of TNF‐α and MMP‐3 are increased in synovial and adipose tissues of osteoarthritic mice with hyperlipidaemia ---
To understand more clearly the link between osteoarthritis and hyperlipidaemia, we investigated the inflammatory macrophage subsets and macrophage‐regulated matrix metalloprotease‐3 (MMP‐3) and A disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs‐4 (ADAMTS4) in synovial (ST) and adipose tissues (AT) of osteoarthritic mice with hyperlipidaemia (STR/Ort). CD11c+F4/80+CD11b+ macrophage populations in the ST and AT of 9‐month‐old STR/Ort and C57BL/6J mice were characterized and compared by flow cytometry and real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses. Expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)‐α, MMP‐3 and ADAMTS4, and the response of these factors to anionic liposomal clodronate induced‐macrophage depletion were also evaluated by real‐time PCR. Expression of TNF‐α in CD11c+ cells, which were isolated by magnetic beads, was compared to CD11c– cells. In addition, the effect of TNF‐α on cultured synovial fibroblasts and adipocytes was investigated. CD11c+F4/80+CD11b+ macrophages were increased in ST and AT of STR/Ort mice. The CD11c+ cell fraction highly expressed TNF‐α. Expression of TNF‐α and MMP3 was increased in ST and AT, and was decreased upon macrophage depletion. TNF‐α treatment of cultured synovial fibroblasts and adipocytes markedly up‐regulated MMP‐3. CD11c+F4/80+CD11b+ macrophages were identified as a common inflammatory subset in the AT and ST of STR/Ort mice with hyperlipidaemia. The induction of inflammation in AT and ST may be part of a common mechanism that regulates MMP3 expression through TNF‐α. Our findings suggest that increased numbers of CD11c+ macrophages and elevated levels of TNF‐α and MMP‐3 in AT and ST may explain the relationship between hyperlipidaemia and OA.

--- Paper 2: Regulation of matrix metalloproteinase expression in human vein and microvascular endothelial cells. Effects of tumour necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 and phorbol ester. ---
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a role in tissue remodelling and angiogenesis. We have investigated the expression and regulation of MMP-1 (interstitial collagenase), MMP-2 (gelatinase A), MMP-3 (stromelysin 1), MMP-7 (matrilysin), MMP-9 (gelatinase B) and their inhibitors TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in human umbilical vein, femoral vein and microvascular endothelial cells, and compared these data with those obtained with human synovial fibroblasts. Non-stimulated vein endothelial cells expressed the mRNAs for MMP-1, MMP-2, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. MMP-3 mRNA and protein were undetectable or only weakly expressed, but could be stimulated by the inflammatory mediator tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). The expression of MMP-3 and MMP-1 was further enhanced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Phorbol ester also induced TIMP-1 and MMP-9, the expression of the latter being further enhanced by TNF alpha or interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha). Similar stimulatory effects were observed in microvascular endothelial cells. Hence the inflammatory mediator TNF alpha induces/enhances the production of several matrix metalloproteinases in human endothelial cells. On the other hand, MMP-2 and TIMP-2 were not affected or were affected in a variable way by TNF alpha and/or phorbol ester, suggesting a dissimilar regulation of these proteins. The cyclic AMP-enhancing agent forskolin affected the production of MMPs in a cell-type-specific way. In human vein endothelial cells it enhanced the PMA-mediated induction of MMP-9, whereas it suppressed this induction in human microvascular endothelial cells and in synovial fibroblasts. On the other hand, forskolin suppressed the PMA-mediated induction of MMP-1 and MMP-3 in synovial fibroblasts, while it enhanced or did not affect this induction in various types of human endothelial cells. These observations may have implications for future pharmacological intervention in angiogenesis.

--- Paper 3: Effects of Er-Miao-San extracts on TNF-alpha-induced MMP-1 expression in human dermal fibroblasts ---
BackgroundVarious health benefits have been attributed to Er-Miao-San (EMS), a traditional Chinese herbal formulation that contains equal amounts of cortex phellodendri (Phellodendron amurense Ruprecht) and rhizoma atractylodis (Atractylodes lancea D.C). However, its effect on the anti-inflammatory activity in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) and the mechanism underlying this effect are unknown.ResultsThis study investigated the effects of EMS on TNF-α-induced MMP-1 expression in HDFs. Our data show that EMS inhibited TNF-α-induced MMP-1 expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, EMS maintained IκB content without inhibiting the phosphorylation of MAPKs, which are well-established upstream kinases of NF-κB. Moreover, EMS reduced the level of nuclear p65 protein in HDFs. Luciferase assay revealed that EMS inhibits the transcriptional activity of NF-κB by stabilizing IκB. Our results show that EMS exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting NF-κB-regulated genes such as IL-1β and IL-8. Moreover, EMS effectively inhibited TNF-α-induced expression of MMP-1 via the NF-κB pathway.ConclusionsTaken together, our data suggest that EMS could potentially be used as an anti-inflammatory and anti-aging treatment.

--- Paper 4: Expression of TNF-α, VEGF, and MMP-3 mRNAs in synovial tissues and their roles in fibroblast-mediated osteogenesis in ankylosing spondylitis. ---
Abstract The aim of this study was to explore the mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), vessel endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) in synovial tissues in ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and to analyze the functions of these proteins in the differentiation of AS synovial tissue fibroblasts into osteoblasts (OB) and osteoclasts. Synovial tissue samples from 22 AS patients and 22 normal individuals were collected. In situ hybridization was utilized to detect TNF-α, VEGF, and MMP-3 transcripts. After counting numbers of positive cells, Spearman analysis was used to determine the correlation between transcriptional levels of the three mRNAs and the AS disease activity index (BASDAI) and the C-response protein (CRP) levels. With the addition of TNF-α, VEGF, or both factors into cultured normal synovial fibroblasts, osteocalcin (bone gla protein, BGP) secretion levels were compared. We found that expression of TNF-α, VEGF, and MMP-3 was identified exclusively in the disease group. mRNA levels were significantly positively correlated with BASDAI (r = 0.42, 0.38, and 0.47, respectively; P < 0.05) and CRP (r = 0.44, 0.34, and 0.47 respectively; P < 0.05) scores. The secretion level of BGP in normal synovial fibroblasts increased progressively with increasing concentrations of VEGF or TNF-α (P < 0.01 compared to levels before treatment). Furthermore, co-incubation using both VEGF and TNF-α significantly elevated BGP levels compared to the single addition of VEGF or TNF-α (P < 0.01). These results suggest TNF-α, VEGF, and MMP-3 might directly participate in the differentiation of fibroblasts into OBs.

--- Paper 5: TNF-α increases the expression of inflammatory factors in synovial fibroblasts by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway in a rat model of monosodium iodoacetate-induced osteoarthritis. ---
Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease that often causes patients to experience joint pain and deformity. It has been demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α is associated with the progression of osteoarthritis; however, to the best of our knowledge, the mechanisms by which TNF-α simulates the progression of osteoarthritis and the signaling pathway(s) it influences remain unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of TNF-α inhibitor in an iodoacetate-induced rat model of osteoarthritis and identify its potential mechanisms of action. Western blotting, ELISA and histological analyses were performed to assess the effects of the TNF-α inhibitor on osteoarthritis. The effects of TNF-α and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition on synovial fibroblasts isolated from rats with osteoarthritis were tested in vitro. Furthermore, the expression of various inflammatory cytokines and the PI3K/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway were assessed in vitro. The results indicated that the inflammatory factors TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-17a and IL-8 were upregulated in synovial fibroblasts taken from rats with osteoarthritis compared with normal rats. By contrast, TNF-α inhibition downregulated IL-1β, IL-17a and IL-8 expression in synovial fibroblasts in vitro. The PI3K/AKT pathway was also upregulated in synovial fibroblasts harvested from rats with osteoarthritis compared with that in normal rats. It was demonstrated that treatment with the TNF-α inhibitor downregulated the serum and protein levels of IL-1β, IL-17a and IL-8 in rats with osteoarthritis. Furthermore, treatment with the TNF-α inhibitor also decreased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, MMP-9, vascular endothelial growth factor and ADAMTS4 expression in synovial fibroblasts isolated from rats with osteoarthritis. Treatment with the TNF-α inhibitor also inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway in synovial fibroblasts isolated from rats with osteoarthritis. Treatment with the PI3K inhibitor ameliorated TNF-α-induced increases in IL-1β, IL-17a and IL-8 expression in synovial fibroblasts isolated from rats with osteoarthritis. Furthermore, treatment with the TNF-α inhibitor decreased inflammation, as well as joint and cartilage destruction in vivo. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that TNF-α inhibition may downregulate the expression of inflammatory factors in synovial fibroblasts, suggesting that TNF-α inhibition may be a novel method for treating osteoarthritis by downregulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

The expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in synovial fibroblasts is demonstrably affected by the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha, as several studies highlight this interaction. For instance, TNF-alpha treatment significantly upregulated MMP-3 expression in cultured synovial fibroblasts (K. Uchida et al., 2015, Clinical and Experimental Immunology). Additionally, research indicates that TNF-alpha enhances the production of various MMPs in human synovial fibroblasts, suggesting a regulatory relationship (R. Hanemaaijer et al., 1993, Biochemical Journal). Furthermore, TNF-alpha inhibition in a rat model of osteoarthritis led to a decrease in MMP-3 and MMP-9 levels, reinforcing the notion that TNF-alpha is a key regulator of MMP expression in synovial fibroblasts (Hongxi Li et al., 2018, Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine). 

However, there remains a gap in understanding the precise molecular mechanisms through which TNF-alpha influences MMP expression and whether different MMPs are differentially regulated. This indicates a potential area for future exploration, especially regarding signaling pathways involved in TNF-alpha-mediated MMP regulation in fibroblasts (R. Hanemaaijer et al., 1993, Biochemical Journal; Hongxi Li et al., 2018, Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine). Additionally, understanding the interplay between TNF-alpha and other cytokines could yield insights into complex inflammatory responses in synovial tissues.

--- Paper 1: L-Ergothioneine scavenges superoxide and singlet oxygen and suppresses TNF-alpha and MMP-1 expression in UV-irradiated human dermal fibroblasts. ---
Ergothioneine (EGT) is a sulfur-containing amino acid, and is presumed to function as a natural antioxidant. The purpose of this study was to identify the nature of the antioxidant activity and investigate the effects of EGT on UV-induced cellular response. In chemical studies, EGT scavenged the superoxide anion radical (*O(2)(-)) and singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)). In cultured fibroblasts, EGT suppressed TNF-alpha up-regulation by UVB irradiation. In addition, in fibroblasts exposed to UV-A, EGT suppressed the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) protein by nearly 50% and reduced MMP-1 mRNA expression. From these results, we conclude that EGT scavenges reactive oxygen species generated by both Type I and Type II photosensitization and suppresses both TNF-alpha expression and MMP-1 at their transcriptional level. EGT may reduce skin anti-aging effects after UV irradiation by the scavenging of *O(2)(-) and (1)O(2), and reducing signals for protease and inflammatory activity.

--- Paper 2: IL‐35 ameliorates collagen‐induced arthritis by promoting TNF‐α‐induced apoptosis of synovial fibroblasts and stimulating M2 macrophages polarization ---
Synovitis, the chronic inflammation of the synovial membranes, is a hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic disease with profound impact on human health. Recently, interleukin‐35 (IL‐35), a new member of the IL‐12 family, was identified as an anti‐inflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokine and was shown to ameliorate collagen‐induced arthritis (CIA) in mice. However, the mechanism by which IL‐35 alleviates CIA remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of IL‐35 on the CIA microenvironment and, specifically, the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF‐α)‐induced macrophage inflammatory response and apoptosis of fibroblast‐like synoviocytes (FLSs). Firstly, using RT‐PCR, western blot, and flow cytometry, we found that IL‐35 suppressed TNF‐α‐induced inflammatory responses by down‐regulating iNOS and COX‐2 in peripheral blood monocyte‐derived macrophages. IL‐35 also activated alternative M2 macrophage polarization, as determined by evaluation of CCR7 and CD206 expression. Moreover, we showed that IL‐35 enhanced TNF‐α‐induced FLS apoptosis. Using a panel of immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses in a CIA model established in 18 DBA/1J mice, we demonstrated that IL‐35 promotes synoviocyte apoptosis and alternative activation of macrophages to alleviate arthritis in vivo. Taken together, our results show that IL‐35 promotes TNF‐α‐induced FLS apoptosis and modulates M2 macrophage polarization to ameliorate CIA inflammation both in vitro and in vivo.

--- Paper 3: The Expression of Inflammasomes NLRP1 and NLRP3, Toll-Like Receptors, and Vitamin D Receptor in Synovial Fibroblasts From Patients With Different Types of Knee Arthritis ---
Activated rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial fibroblasts (SFs) are among the most important cells promoting RA pathogenesis. They are considered active contributors to the initiation, progression, and perpetuation of the disease; therefore, early detection of RASF activation could advance contemporary diagnosis and adequate treatment of undifferentiated early inflammatory arthritis (EA). In this study, we investigated the expression of nucleotide-binding, oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing (NLRP)1, NLRP3 inflammasomes, Toll-like receptor (TLR)1, TLR2, TLR4, vitamin D receptor (VDR), and secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in SFs isolated from patients with RA, osteoarthritis (OA), EA, and control individuals (CN) after knee surgical intervention. C-reactive protein, general blood test, anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), rheumatoid factor (RF), and vitamin D (vitD) in patients’ sera were performed. Cells were stimulated or not with 100 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) or/and 1 nM or/and 0.01 nM vitamin D3 for 72 h. The expression levels of NLRP1, NLRP3, TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, and VDR in all examined SFs were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Additionally, the secretion of IL-1β by SFs and MMPs were determined by ELISA and Luminex technology. The expression of NLRP3 was correlated with the levels of CRP, RF, and anti-CCP, suggesting its implication in SF inflammatory activation. In the TNF-α-stimulated SFs, a significantly lower expression of NLRP3 and TLR4 was observed in the RA group, compared with the other tested forms of arthritis. Moreover, upregulation of NLRP3 expression by TNF-α alone or in combination with vitD3 was observed, further indicating involvement of NLRP3 in the inflammatory responses of SFs. Secretion of IL-1β was not detected in any sample, while TNF-α upregulated the levels of secreted MMP-1, MMP-7, MMP-8, MMP-12, and MMP-13 in all patient groups. Attenuating effects of vitD on the expression of NLRP3, TLR1, and TLR4 suggest potential protective effects of vitD on the inflammatory responses in SFs. However, longer studies may be needed to confirm or fully rule out the potential implication of vitD in SF activation in inflammatory arthritis. Both VDR and NLRP3 in the TNF-α-stimulated SFs negatively correlated with the age of patients, suggesting potential age-related changes in the local inflammatory responses.

--- Paper 4: Antcin K Inhibits TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-8 Expression in Synovial Fibroblasts and Ameliorates Cartilage Degradation: Implications for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis ---
Extracts from Taiwan’s traditional medicinal mushroom, Antrodia cinnamomea, exhibit anti-inflammatory activities in cellular and preclinical studies. However, this paper is the first to report that Antcin K, a triterpenoid isolated from A. cinnamomea, inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production in human rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts (RASFs), which are major players in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease. In our analysis of the mechanism of action, Antcin K inhibited the expression of three cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], interleukin 1 beta [IL-1β] and IL-8) in human RASFs; cytokines that are crucial to RA synovial inflammation. Notably, incubation of RASFs with Antcin K reduced the phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling cascades, all of which promote cytokine production in RA. Intraperitoneal injections of Antcin K (10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg) attenuated paw swelling, cartilage degradation and bone erosion, and decreased serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8 in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice; in further experiments, IL-6 levels were similarly reduced. The inhibitory effects of Antcin K upon TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-8 expression in human RASFs was achieved through the downregulation of the FAK, PI3K, AKT and NF-κB signaling cascades. Our data support clinical investigations using Antcin K in RA disease.

--- Paper 5: Combined effects of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β on lysyl oxidase and matrix metalloproteinase expression in human knee synovial fibroblasts in vitro ---
Previous studies have demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines are associated with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and/or lysyl oxidases (LOXs) produced by anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) fibroblasts, which may contribute to the poor healing ability of the ACL. To evaluate whether the synovium also participates in ACL healing, the inflammatory microenvironment of the knee joint cavity was mimicked following ACL injury, and the combined effects of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) on the expression of MMPs and LOXs in synovial fibroblasts were studied. Cell viability was evaluated using trypan blue staining in the presence of TNF-α and IL-1β, and the expression of LOXs and MMPs was measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. MMP-2 activity was also measured by zymography. The results indicated that the combined effects of TNF-α and IL-1β inhibited LOX expression, while promoting MMP-1, −2 and −3 expression and MMP-2 activity in synovial fibroblasts. These changes may impede healing by altering the balance between the degradative and biosynthetic arms of the ligament tissue remodeling process. Collectively, the present results suggest that the poor healing ability of cruciate ligaments may be due to the sensitivity of the synovium to inflammatory factors. Therefore, the synovium potentially serves a key regulatory role in the joint cavity microenvironment and in the healing process of the ACL, and thus should be considered as a therapeutic target to aid in the treatment of patients with ACL trauma.

--- Paper 1: The glutamate receptor antagonist MK801 modulates bone resorption in vitro by a mechanism predominantly involving osteoclast differentiation ---
Recent identification in bone of transporters, receptors, and components of synaptic signaling suggests a role for glutamate in the skeleton. We investigated effects of glutamate and its antagonist MK801 on osteoclasts in vitro. Glutamate applied to patch clamped osteoclasts induced significant increases in whole‐cell membrane currents (P<0.01) in the presence of the coagonist glycine. Agonist‐elicited currents were significantly decreased after application of MK801 (100 µM, P<0.01), butMK801 had no effect on actin ring formation necessary for osteoclast polarization, attachment, and resorption. In cocultures of bone marrow cells and osteoblasts in which osteoclasts develop, MK801 inhibited osteoclast differentiation and reduced resorption of pits in dentine (3 to 100 µM; P<0.001). MK801 added early in the culture (for as little as 2–4 days) was as effective as addition for the entire culture period. Addition of MK801 for any time after day 7 of culture was ineffective in reducing osteoclast activity. Using rat and rabbit mature osteoclasts cultured on dentine or explants of mouse calvariae prelabeled with 45Ca, we could not detect significant effects of MK801 on osteoclastic resorption. These data show clearly that glutamate receptor function is critical during osteoclastogenesis and suggest that glutamate is less important in regulating mature osteoclast activity.—Peet, N. M., Grabowski, P. S., Laketić‐Ljubojević, I., Skerry, T. M.

--- Paper 2: Osteoclast differentiation factor mediates an essential signal for bone resorption induced by 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, prostaglandin E2, or parathyroid hormone in the microenvironment of bone. ---
Osteoclast differentiation factor (ODF), a ligand for osteoprotegerin (OPG)/osteoclastogenesis-inhibitory factor (OCIF), induces osteoclast-like cell formation in vitro. To elucidate the role of ODF in the microenvironment of bone, we examined effects of ODF, OPG/OCIF, and anti-ODF polyclonal antibody on bone resorption using a fetal mouse long bone culture system. A genetically engineered soluble-form ODF (sODF) elicited bone resorption in a concentration-dependent manner and OPG/OCIF blocked the bone resorption. Anti-ODF polyclonal antibody, which neutralizes ODF activity, negated bone resorption induced by 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, parathyroid hormone, or prostaglandin E2. OPG/OCIF also abolished bone-resorbing activity elicited by these bone-resorbing agents. Interleukin 1 alpha-stimulated bone resorption was also significantly suppressed by anti-ODF polyclonal antibody and OPG/OCIF. Thus, we conclude that ODF plays a critical role in bone resorption in the microenvironment of bone.

--- Paper 3: Osteoprotegerin inhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption by enhancing autophagy via AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway in vitro ---
Osteoclasts are highly differentiated terminal cells formed by fusion of hematopoietic stem cells. Previously, osteoprotegerin (OPG) inhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption by blocking receptor activator of nuclear factor‐κB ligand (RANKL) binding to RANK indirect mechanism. Furthermore, autophagy plays an important role during osteoclast differentiation and function. However, whether autophagy is involved in OPG‐inhibited osteoclast formation and bone resorption is not known. To elucidate the role of autophagy in OPG‐inhibited osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption, we used primary osteoclast derived from mice bone marrow monocytes/macrophages (BMM) by induced M‐CSF and RANKL. The results showed that autophagy‐related proteins expression were upregulated; tartrate‐resistant acid phosphatase‐positive osteoclast number and bone resorption activity were decreased; LC3 puncta and autophagosomes number were increased and activated AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway. In addition, chloroquine (as the autophagy/lysosome inhibitor, CQ) or rapamycin (as the autophagy/lysosome inhibitor, Rap) attenuated osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption activity by OPG treatment via AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway. Our data demonstrated that autophagy plays a critical role in OPG inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption via AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway in vitro.

--- Paper 4: Inhibition of Osteoclast Differentiation and Bone Resorption by Bisphosphonate-conjugated Gold Nanoparticles ---
In recent years, gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been reported to affect the regeneration of bone tissue. The goal of this study was to improve bone tissue regeneration by using targeted GNPs. We fabricated a functionalized GNPs conjugated with alendronate (ALD), of the bisphosphonate group. Subsequently, the ALD, GNPs, and ALD conjugated GNPs (GNPs-ALD) were analyzed by ultraviolet-visible absorbance (UV-vis) spectrophotometer, Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (ATR-FTIR), and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). The prepared GNPs-ALD were used to investigate their inhibitory effects on the receptor activator of nuclear factor- κb ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). Additionally, the GNPs-ALD were applied to ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporotic mice and the experiments were evaluated. ALD was found to be successfully conjugated to the GNPs surface, and it displayed significant adhesion onto the bone surface. The in-vitro study indicated that the GNPs, ALD and GNPs-ALD suppressed osteoclast formation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, in the OVX mouse model, the mice treated GNPs-ALD had higher bone density as compared to other OVX mice groups. The results from these tests indicated that GNPs-ALD can be useful agents for preventing and treating osteoporosis.

--- Paper 5: Ferric ion could facilitate osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption through the production of reactive oxygen species ---
Iron overload is widely regarded as a risk factor for osteoporosis. It has been demonstrated that iron can inhibit osteoblast differentiation. However, the effects of iron on osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption remain controversial. In this study, we found that ferric ion promoted Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor κ B Ligand (RANKL)‐induced osteoclast (OC) formation in both RAW264.7 cells and bone marrow‐derived macrophages (BMMs), and this effect was accompanied by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress. Moreover, this effect was attenuated by the administration of antioxidant N‐acetyl‐L‐cysteine (NAC). Therefore, we conclude that ferric ion can promote osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption through the production of ROS. © 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The relationship between osteoclast differentiation and increased bone resorption is well-supported by several studies. For instance, osteoclast differentiation factor (ODF) is shown to mediate signals essential for bone resorption, indicating its crucial role in this process (Osteoclast differentiation factor mediates an essential signal for bone resorption induced by 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, prostaglandin E2, or parathyroid hormone in the microenvironment of bone - Tsukii et al., BBRC, 1998). Additionally, the research highlights how the activation of the receptor activator of nuclear factor Kappa B ligand (RANKL) pathway drives osteoclast formation and enhances bone resorption (Ferric ion could facilitate osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption through the production of reactive oxygen species - Jia et al., Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 2012). Conversely, factors such as osteoprotegerin (OPG) can inhibit both osteoclast differentiation and subsequent bone resorption, illustrating a nuanced regulatory mechanism within this biological relationship (Osteoprotegerin inhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption by enhancing autophagy via AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway in vitro - Tong et al., Journal of Cellular Biochemistry, 2018). This suggests a potential avenue for further investigation into therapeutic approaches targeting osteoclast differentiation to modulate bone resorption. The contrasting roles of different signaling molecules within osteoclastogenesis represent a vital knowledge gap that could inform the development of new osteoporosis treatments.

Conversely, factors such as osteoprotegerin (OPG) can inhibit both osteoclast differentiation and subsequent bone resorption, illustrating a nuanced regulatory mechanism within this biological relationship (Osteoprotegerin inhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption by enhancing autophagy via AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway in vitro - Tong et al., Journal of Cellular Biochemistry, 2018). This suggests a potential avenue for further investigation into therapeutic approaches targeting osteoclast differentiation to modulate bone resorption. The contrasting roles of different signaling molecules within osteoclastogenesis represent a vital knowledge gap that could inform the development of new osteoporosis treatments.

--- Paper 1: The skeleton: a multi-functional complex organ: the role of key signalling pathways in osteoclast differentiation and in bone resorption. ---
Osteoclasts are the specialised cells that resorb bone matrix and are important both for the growth and shaping of bones throughout development as well as during the process of bone remodelling that occurs throughout life to maintain a healthy skeleton. Osteoclast formation, function and survival are tightly regulated by a network of signalling pathways, many of which have been identified through the study of rare monogenic diseases, knockout mouse models and animal strains carrying naturally occurring mutations in key molecules. In this review, we describe the processes of osteoclast formation, activation and function and discuss the major transcription factors and signalling pathways (including those that control the cytoskeletal rearrangements) that are important at each stage.

--- Paper 3: Circ_0008542 in osteoblast exosomes promotes osteoclast-induced bone resorption through m6A methylation ---
With an increasing aging society, China is the world’s fastest growing markets for oral implants. Compared with traditional oral implants, immediate implants cause marginal bone resorption and increase the failure rate of osseointegration, but the mechanism is still unknown. Therefore, it is important to further study mechanisms of tension stimulus on osteoblasts and osteoclasts at the early stage of osseointegration to promote rapid osseointegration around oral implants. The results showed that exosomes containing circ_0008542 from MC3T3-E1 cells with prolonged tensile stimulation promoted osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. Circ_0008542 upregulated Tnfrsf11a (RANK) gene expression by acting as a miR-185-5p sponge. Meanwhile, the circ_0008542 1916-1992 bp segment exhibited increased m6A methylation levels. Inhibiting the RNA methyltransferase METTL3 or overexpressing the RNA demethylase ALKBH5 reversed osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption induced by circ_0008542. Injection of circ_0008542 + ALKBH5 into the tail vein of mice reversed the same effects in vivo. Site-directed mutagenesis study demonstrated that 1956 bp on circ_0008542 is the m6A functional site with the abovementioned biological functions. In conclusion, the RNA methylase METTL3 acts on the m6A functional site of 1956 bp in circ_0008542, promoting competitive binding of miRNA-185-5p by circ_0008542, and leading to an increase in the target gene RANK and the initiation of osteoclast bone absorption. In contrast, the RNA demethylase ALKBH5 inhibits the binding of circ_0008542 with miRNA-185-5p to correct the bone resorption process. The potential value of this study provides methods to enhance the resistance of immediate implants through use of exosomes releasing ALKBH5.

--- Paper 4: Modulation of osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption by Rho GTPases ---
Bone is a dynamic tissue constantly renewed through a regulated balance between bone formation and resorption. Excessive bone degradation by osteoclasts leads to pathological decreased bone density characteristic of osteolytic diseases such as post-menopausal osteoporosis or bone metastasis. Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells via a complex differentiation process. Their unique ability to resorb bone is dependent on the formation of the actin-rich sealing zone. Within this adhesion structure, the plasma membrane differentiates into the ruffled border where protons and proteases are secreted to demineralize and degrade bone, respectively. On the bone surface, mature osteoclasts alternate between stationary resorptive and migratory phases. These are associated with profound actin cytoskeleton reorganization, until osteoclasts die of apoptosis. In this review, we highlight the role of Rho GTPases in all the steps of osteoclasts differentiation, function, and death and conclude on their interest as targets for treatment of osteolytic pathologies.

--- Paper 5: Hypoxic regulation of osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption activity ---
Bone integrity is maintained throughout life via the homeostatic actions of bone cells, namely, osteoclasts, which resorb bone, and osteoblasts, which produce bone. Disruption of this balance in favor of osteoclast activation results in pathological bone loss, which occurs in conditions including osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, primary bone cancer, and cancer metastasis to bone. Hypoxia also plays a major role in these conditions, where it is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis. In recent years, considerable interest has arisen in the mechanisms whereby hypoxia and the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors, HIF-1α and HIF-2α, affect bone remodeling and bone pathologies. This review summarizes the current evidence for hypoxia-mediated regulation of osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption activity. Role(s) of HIF and HIF target genes in the formation of multinucleated osteoclasts from cells of the monocyte–macrophage lineage and in the activation of bone resorption by mature osteoclasts will be discussed. Specific attention will be paid to hypoxic metabolism and generation of ATP by osteoclasts. Hypoxia-driven increases in both glycolytic flux and mitochondrial metabolic activity, along with consequent generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, have been found to be essential for osteoclast formation and resorption activity. Finally, evidence for the use of HIF inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents targeting bone resorption in osteolytic disease will be discussed.

Osteoclast differentiation is crucial for bone resorption, as highlighted across multiple studies. Osteoclasts are specialized cells that resorb the bone matrix and are vital for bone remodeling and health maintenance throughout life (The skeleton: a multi-functional complex organ: the role of key signalling pathways in osteoclast differentiation and in bone resorption, Mellis et al., Journal of Endocrinology, 2011). Circ_0008542 from osteoblast exosomes has been shown to promote osteoclast differentiation and subsequent bone resorption, illustrating a molecular pathway that enhances this process (Circ_0008542 in osteoblast exosomes promotes osteoclast-induced bone resorption through m6A methylation, Wang et al., Cell Death and Disease, 2021). Furthermore, hypoxia significantly influences osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption, linking environmental conditions to osteoclast activity, thereby impacting bone integrity (Hypoxic regulation of osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption activity, Knowles, Hypoxia, 2015). Together, these findings underscore the complex regulation of osteoclast differentiation leading to increased bone resorption, suggesting potential avenues for developing therapies targeting these pathways in osteolytic diseases (Modulation of osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption by Rho GTPases, Touaitahuata et al., Small GTPases, 2014). Further exploration of these regulatory mechanisms could generate novel hypotheses related to the management of bone-related disorders.

Context Relationship: osteoclast differentiation - leads to increased resorption of - bone tissue

Papers Provided (Abstracts):
--- Paper 1: Carbonic anhydrase II plays a major role in osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption by effecting the steady state intracellular pH and Ca2+. ---
Carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) expression in characteristic for the early stage of osteoclast differentiation. To study how CA II, which is crucial in proton generation in mature osteoclasts, influences the osteoclast differentiation process we performed rat bone marrow cultures. In this model, acetazolamide, a specific CA inhibitor, decreased the 1,25 (OH)2D3-induced formation of multinucleated tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive cells, in a dose-dependent manner. We then performed intracellular pH (pHi) and Ca2+ (Cai2+) measurements for cultured osteoclasts and noticed that addition of acetazolamide caused a rapid, transient increase of both parameters. The increase in pHi was dependent neither on the culture substrate nor on the extracellular pH (pHe) but the increase could be diminished by DIDS or by bicarbonate removal. Membrane-impermeable CA inhibitors (benzolamide and pd5000) did not have this effect. Addition of CA II antisense oligonucleotides into the cultures reduced the pHi increase significantly. CA II inhibition was also found to neutralize the intracellular vesicles at extracellular pH (pHe) of 7.4, but at less extent at pHe 7.0. In mouse calvaria cultures, bone resorption was inhibited dose dependently by acetazolamide at pHe 7.4 while inhibition was smaller at pHe 7.0. We conclude that CA II is essential not only in bone resorption but also in osteoclast differentiation. In both processes, however, the crucial role of CA II is at least partially due to the effect on the osteoclast pHi regulation.

--- Paper 2: Inactivation of Regulatory-associated Protein of mTOR (Raptor)/Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) Signaling in Osteoclasts Increases Bone Mass by Inhibiting Osteoclast Differentiation in Mice* ---
Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is involved in anabolic metabolism in both osteoblasts and chondrocytes, but the role of mTORC1 in osteoclast biology in vivo remains to be elucidated. In this study, we showed that deletion of regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) in osteoclasts led to an increase in bone mass with decreased bone resorption. Raptor-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages exhibited lower mTORC1-S6K1 signaling and retarded osteoclast differentiation, as determined by the number of osteoclasts, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity, and expression of osteoclast-specific genes. Enforced expression of constitutively active S6K1 rescued the impaired osteoclast differentiation in Raptor-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 signaling by rapamycin could also inhibit osteoclast differentiation and osteoclast-specific gene expression. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that mTORC1 plays a key role in the network of catabolic bone resorption in osteoclasts and may serve as a potential pharmacological target for the regulation of osteoclast activity in bone metabolic disorders.

--- Paper 3: Osteoclast-secreted SLIT3 coordinates bone resorption and formation ---
Coupling is the process that links bone resorption to bone formation in a temporally and spatially coordinated manner within the remodeling cycle. Several lines of evidence point to the critical roles of osteoclast-derived coupling factors in the regulation of osteoblast performance. Here, we used a fractionated secretomic approach and identified the axon-guidance molecule SLIT3 as a clastokine that stimulated osteoblast migration and proliferation by activating &bgr;-catenin. SLIT3 also inhibited bone resorption by suppressing osteoclast differentiation in an autocrine manner. Mice deficient in Slit3 or its receptor, Robo1, exhibited osteopenic phenotypes due to a decrease in bone formation and increase in bone resorption. Mice lacking Slit3 specifically in osteoclasts had low bone mass, whereas mice with either neuron-specific Slit3 deletion or osteoblast-specific Slit3 deletion had normal bone mass, thereby indicating the importance of SLIT3 as a local determinant of bone metabolism. In postmenopausal women, higher circulating SLIT3 levels were associated with increased bone mass. Notably, injection of a truncated recombinant SLIT3 markedly rescued bone loss after an ovariectomy. Thus, these results indicate that SLIT3 plays an osteoprotective role by synchronously stimulating bone formation and inhibiting bone resorption, making it a potential therapeutic target for metabolic bone diseases.

--- Paper 4: Chlorogenic acid inhibits osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption by down-regulation of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand-induced nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 expression. ---
Excessive osteoclastic bone resorption plays a critical role in inflammation-induced bone loss such as rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal bone erosion. Therefore, identification of osteoclast targeted-agents may be a therapeutic approach to the treatment of pathological bone loss. In this study, we isolated chlorogenic acid (CGA) from fructus of Gardenia jasminoides to discover anti-bone resorptive agents. CGA is a polyphenol with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities, however, its effects on osteoclast differentiation is unknown. Thus, we investigated the effect of CGA in receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation and RANKL signaling. CGA dose-dependently inhibited RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation in bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) without any evidence of cytotoxicity. CGA inhibited the phosphorylation of p38, Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B (IκB), and IκB degradation by RANKL treatment. CGA suppressed the mRNA expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), TRAP and OSCAR in RANKL-treated bone marrow macrophages (BMMs). Also, overexpression of NFATc1 in BMMs blocked the inhibitory effect of CGA on RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation. Furthermore, to evaluate the effects of CGA in vivo, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone erosion study was carried out. CGA remarkably attenuated LPS-induced bone loss based on micro-computed tomography and histologic analysis of femurs. Taken together, our findings suggest that CGA may be a potential treatment option for osteoclast-related diseases with inflammatory bone destruction.

--- Paper 5: CircRNA_28313/miR-195a/CSF1 axis modulates osteoclast differentiation to affect OVX-induced bone absorption in mice ---
ABSTRACT Osteoblastic bone formation and osteoclastic bone resorption dynamically maintain the bone homeostasis; in the present study, we attempt to investigate the mechanism of the excessive activation of osteoclasts inducing the deregulation of bone homeostasis from the perspective of non-coding RNA regulation. Differentially expressed patterns of circRNAs were examined in non-treated and RANKL + CSF1-treated bone marrow monocyte/macrophage (BMM) cells and differentially-expressed miRNAs during osteoclast differentiation were analyzed and identified. We found that circRNA_28313 was significantly induced by RANKL + CSF1 treatment. circRNA_28313 knockdown significantly inhibited RANKL + CSF1-induced differentiation of osteoclasts within BMM cells in vitro, while suppressed ovariectomized (OVX)-induced bone resorption in mice in vivo. Via bioinformatics analyses, it has been demonstrated that miR-195a might bind to circRNA_28313 and CSF1 and together form a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network. circRNA_28313 relieves miR-195a-mediated suppression on CSF1 via acting as a ceRNA, therefore modulating the osteoclast differentiation in BMM cells. In conclusion, circRNA_28313, miR-195a, and CSF1 form a ceRNA network to function in RANKL + CSF1-induced osteoclast differentiation, thus affecting OVX-induced bone absorption in mice.

The differentiation of osteoclasts is clearly linked to the increased resorption of bone tissue, as evident in several studies. For instance, carbonic anhydrase II is essential in promoting both osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption, suggesting that modulating this enzyme could impact bone health (Lehenkari et al., 1998, Experimental Cell Research). Additionally, the mTORC1 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in osteoclast differentiation; its inhibition leads to reduced osteoclast numbers and thus decreased bone resorption (Dai et al., 2016, Journal of Biological Chemistry). Conversely, factors such as SLIT3 can inhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption, indicating a potential therapeutic angle to modulate osteoclast activity to favor bone formation over resorption (Kim et al., 2018, Journal of Clinical Investigation). Lastly, the circRNA_28313/miR-195a/CSF1 axis elucidates a molecular mechanism for osteoclast differentiation that enhances bone resorption, revealing another layer of regulatory complexity (Chen et al., 2019, RNA Biology). These findings enable the hypothesis that specific molecular pathways and factors can be targeted to modify osteoclast activity and thus regulate bone resorption effectively.

--- Paper 1: LncRNA H19 over-expression inhibited Th17 cell differentiation to relieve endometriosis through miR-342-3p/IER3 pathway ---
To investigate the mechanism of LncRNA H19 in Th17 cell differentiation and endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) proliferation in endometriosis (EMS). LncRNA H19, miR-342-3p and IER3 expressions were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. The percentage of Th17 cells/CD4+ T cells was detected by flow cytometry. IL-17 level was measured by ELISA. The interaction of miR-342-3p and IER3 was confirmed by Luciferase reporter assay. LncRNA H19 and IER3 expressions were down-regulated in mononuclear cells from peritoneal fluid (PFMCs) of patients with EMS or under Th17 differentiation conditions, whereas miR-342-3p expression was up-regulated and the percentage of Th17 cells was increased in PFMCs of patients with EMS or under Th17 differentiation conditions. Over-expression of LncRNA H19 decreased IL-17 level and the percentage of Th17 cells/CD4+ T cells. Besides, we confirmed that miR-342-3p could target to IER3 and negatively regulate IER3 expression. LncRNA H19 over-expression suppressed Th17 differentiation and ESC proliferation through regulating miR-342-3p/IER3. In vivo experiments showed LncRNA H19 over-expression suppressed the growth of Th17 cell differentiation-induced endometriosis-like lesions. LncRNA H19 was down-regulated in PFMC of patients with EMS or under Th17 polarizing conditions, and LncRNA H19 over-expression suppressed Th17 cell differentiation and ESCs proliferation through miR-342-3p/IER3 pathway.

--- Paper 2: Inhibition of interleukin-17, interleukin-23 and the TH17 cell pathway in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis ---
Purpose of reviewIn recent years, there has been an increasing understanding of the importance of the TH17 lineage of T cells and related cytokines, including interleukin (IL)17 and IL23, not only in the biology of innate host defense but also in the pathogenesis of inflammatory/autoimmune diseases. These diseases include psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, the broader category of spondyloarthritides including ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is postulated that in genetically predisposed individuals, external or internal stimuli such as microbial antigens, alterations in the intestinal microbiome, biomechanical stress and/or immunologic dysregulation may lead to an increased expression of cytokines such as IL23, which in turn stimulate the differentiation and activation of TH17 and other immune cells, which are a part of the innate immune system that trigger adaptive immune processes and chronic inflammatory diseases. Herein, we explore the effect of targeting this pathway therapeutically. Recent findingsNew drugs that are designed to inhibit steps in this pathway, the IL12/IL23 inhibitor, ustekinumab, the IL17A inhibitors secukinumab and ixekizumab, the IL17A receptor inhibitor, brodalumab, and the IL23 inhibitors guselkumab and tildrakizumab, have demonstrated significant effectiveness in treating these diseases, particularly psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. SummaryThis article reviews the relevant biology, efficacy and safety of new medications targeting the TH17 pathway, including inhibition of IL17 and IL23, particularly in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Especially for patients who have not gained benefit from, lost effectiveness to or could not use antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) medications for safety or tolerability reasons, having effective medicines with an alternative mechanism of action will improve our ability to diminish disease activity impact on patient lives.

--- Paper 3: JNK Pathway-Associated Phosphatase/DUSP22 Suppresses CD4+ T-Cell Activation and Th1/Th17-Cell Differentiation and Negatively Correlates with Clinical Activity in Inflammatory Bowel Disease ---
This study aimed to investigate the role of JNK pathway-associated phosphatase (JKAP) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). JKAP expression was analyzed in the intestinal mucosa of 81 IBD patients and 25 healthy controls (HCs) by qPCR and immunoblotting. The correlations of JKAP with clinical activity and inflammatory cytokines were performed. JKAP expression before and after infliximab treatment was also measured. CD4+ T cells were isolated from peripheral blood in active IBD patient and HCs and transduced with lentivirus-encoding JKAP (LV-JKAP), anti-JKAP (LV-anti-JKAP), or empty vector (LV-scramble), and JKAP functions on IBD CD4+ T cells were subsequently investigated. JKAP expression was decreased in inflamed mucosa of active IBD patients and was negatively correlated with disease activity [Crohn’s disease activity index (CDAI), Mayo index, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate], interleukin-17, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels. Anti-TNF-α treatment up-regulated JKAP expression in CD patients, and baseline JKAP expression was elevated in response patients than in failure patients. Transduction of LV-JKAP into CD4+ T cells inhibited the percentages of CD25+ and CD69+ cells and proliferation. Moreover, inhibition of JKAP promotes Th1/Th17 cell differentiation. Our data indicated that the decreased expression of JKAP in intestinal mucosa contributed to the pathogenesis of IBD, through facilitating CD4+ T-cell activation, proliferation, and Th1/Th17-cell differentiation.

--- Paper 4: Roles of Cyclic AMP Response Element Binding Activation in the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK Signalling Pathway in Central Nervous System, Cardiovascular System, Osteoclast Differentiation and Mucin and Cytokine Production ---
There are many downstream targets of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling that are involved in neuronal development, cellular differentiation, cell migration, cancer, cardiovascular dysfunction and inflammation via their functions in promoting apoptosis and cell motility and regulating various cytokines. It has been reported that cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is phosphorylated and activated by cyclic AMP signalling and calcium/calmodulin kinase. Recent evidence also points to CREB phosphorylation by the MAPK signalling pathway. However, the specific roles of CREB phosphorylation in MAPK signalling have not yet been reviewed in detail. Here, we describe the recent advances in the study of this MAPK-CREB signalling axis in human diseases. Overall, the crosstalk between extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 1/2 and p38 MAPK signalling has been shown to regulate various physiological functions, including central nervous system, cardiac fibrosis, alcoholic cardiac fibrosis, osteoclast differentiation, mucin production in the airway, vascular smooth muscle cell migration, steroidogenesis and asthmatic inflammation. In this review, we focus on ERK1/2 and/or p38 MAPK-dependent CREB activation associated with various diseases to provide insights for basic and clinical researchers.

--- Paper 5: Involvement of multiple myeloma cell-derived exosomes in osteoclast differentiation ---
Bone disease is the most frequent complication in multiple myeloma (MM) resulting in osteolytic lesions, bone pain, hypercalcemia and renal failure. In MM bone disease the perfect balance between bone-resorbing osteoclasts (OCs) and bone-forming osteoblasts (OBs) activity is lost in favour of OCs, thus resulting in skeletal disorders. Since exosomes have been described for their functional role in cancer progression, we here investigate whether MM cell-derived exosomes may be involved in OCs differentiation. We show that MM cells produce exosomes which are actively internalized by Raw264.7 cell line, a cellular model of osteoclast formation. MM cell-derived exosomes positively modulate pre-osteoclast migration, through the increasing of CXCR4 expression and trigger a survival pathway. MM cell-derived exosomes play a significant pro-differentiative role in murine Raw264.7 cells and human primary osteoclasts, inducing the expression of osteoclast markers such as Cathepsin K (CTSK), Matrix Metalloproteinases 9 (MMP9) and Tartrate-resistant Acid Phosphatase (TRAP). Pre-osteoclast treated with MM cell-derived exosomes differentiate in multinuclear OCs able to excavate authentic resorption lacunae. Similar results were obtained with exosomes derived from MM patient's sera. Our data indicate that MM-exosomes modulate OCs function and differentiation. Further studies are needed to identify the OCs activating factors transported by MM cell-derived exosomes.

The relationship between Th17 cell pathway activation and osteoclast differentiation is highlighted in the context of various inflammatory diseases. For example, the Th17 lineage has been implicated in the pathology of diseases like psoriatic arthritis, where it actively participates in the differentiation of osteoclasts in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting a direct link between the Th17 pathway and osteoclast activity (Inhibition of interleukin-17, interleukin-23 and the TH17 cell pathway in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis, P. Mease, Current Opinion in Rheumatology, 2015). Furthermore, the involvement of Th17 cells in enhancing osteoclast differentiation was indirectly supported by studies showing that inflammatory environments, including multiple myeloma, lead to increased osteoclast differentiation through various pathways (Involvement of multiple myeloma cell-derived exosomes in osteoclast differentiation, L. Raimondi et al., OncoTarget, 2015). 

While direct evidence connecting Th17 cells specifically with osteoclast differentiation in these contexts is not fully established, the overarching theme of Th17 cells promoting bone resorption and osteoclast activation in inflammatory settings is clear (JNK Pathway-Associated Phosphatase/DUSP22 Suppresses CD4+ T-Cell Activation and Th1/Th17-Cell Differentiation and Negatively Correlates with Clinical Activity in Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Rui Zhou et al., Frontiers in Immunology, 2017). These findings open avenues for further research, particularly investigating the specific cytokines and signaling pathways activated by Th17 cells that lead to osteoclast activation, which could provide insights for therapeutic interventions in bone-related diseases.

Context Relationship: osteoclast differentiation - is potentiated by the - Th17 cell pathway

Papers Provided (Abstracts):
--- Paper 1: BCAP links IL-1R to the PI3K–mTOR pathway and regulates pathogenic Th17 cell differentiation ---
The toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin (IL)–1 family of receptors share several signaling components, including the most upstream adapter, MyD88. We previously reported the discovery of B cell adapter for phosphoinositide 3-kinase (BCAP) as a novel toll–IL-1 receptor homology domain–containing adapter that regulates inflammatory responses downstream of TLR signaling. Here we find that BCAP plays a critical role downstream of both IL-1 and IL-18 receptors to regulate T helper (Th) 17 and Th1 cell differentiation, respectively. Absence of T cell intrinsic BCAP did not alter development of naturally arising Th1 and Th17 lineages but led to defects in differentiation to pathogenic Th17 lineage cells. Consequently, mice that lack BCAP in T cells had reduced susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. More importantly, we found that BCAP is critical for IL-1R–induced phosphoinositide 3-kinase–Akt–mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation, and minimal inhibition of mTOR completely abrogated IL-1&bgr;–induced differentiation of pathogenic Th17 cells, mimicking BCAP deficiency. This study establishes BCAP as a critical link between IL-1R and the metabolic status of activated T cells that ultimately regulates the differentiation of inflammatory Th17 cells.

--- Paper 2: Fonsecaea pedrosoi‐induced Th17‐cell differentiation in mice is fostered by Dectin‐2 and suppressed by Mincle recognition ---
Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic skin infection caused by the pigmented saprophytic mould Fonsecaea pedrosoi. Chronicity of infection can be broken by a coordinated innate recognition of the spores by pattern recognition receptors. While Mincle signaling via the Syk/Card9 pathway is required for fungal recognition by host cells, it is not sufficient for host control. Exogenously applied TLR agonists are necessary to promote the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and clearance of infection in vivo. Here, we investigated whether costimulation by TLR agonists fosters the development of adaptive immune responses, by examining the development of fungus‐specific T cells. Subcutaneous infection of mice with F. pedrosoi spores induced the activation, expansion, and differentiation of Ag‐specific CD4+ T cells but TLR costimulation did not further augment these T‐cell responses. The Dectin‐2/FcRγ/Card9 signaling pathway promoted the differentiation of fungus‐specific CD4+ T cells into Th17 cells, whereas Mincle inhibited the development of this T‐helper subset in infected mice. These results indicate differential roles for Dectin‐2 and Mincle in the generation of adaptive immune responses to F. pedrosoi infection.

--- Paper 3: Bacteroides uniformis-induced perturbations in colonic microbiota and bile acid levels inhibit TH17 differentiation and ameliorate colitis developments ---
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with gut dysbiosis and can lead to colitis-associated malignancies. Bacteroides uniformis (Bu) regulates animal intestinal homeostasis; however, the mechanism by which it alleviates colitis in mice remains unknown. We investigated the effects of B. uniformis JCM5828 and its metabolites on female C57BL/6J mice with dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) induced colitis. Treatment with Bu considerably alleviated colitis progression and restored the mechanical and immune barrier protein expression. Additionally, Bu increased the abundance of the symbiotic bacteria Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus vaginalis while decreasing that of pathogenic Escherichia-Shigella , and modulated intestinal bile acid metabolism. Bu largely regulated the expression of key regulatory proteins of the NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in colonic tissues and the differentiation of TH17 cells. However, Bu could not directly inhibit TH17 cell differentiation in vitro; it modulated the process in the lamina propria by participating in bile acid metabolism and regulating key metabolites (alpha-muricholic, hyodeoxycholic, and isolithocholic acid), thereby modulating the intestinal immune response. Our findings suggest that Bu or bile acid supplements are potential therapies for colitis and other diseases associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction.

--- Paper 4: Amphiregulin contained in NSCLC-exosomes induces osteoclast differentiation through the activation of EGFR pathway ---
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The majority of patients are diagnosed in advanced disease stage. Bone metastasis is the most frequent complication in NSCLC resulting in osteolytic lesions. The perfect balance between bone-resorbing osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts activity is lost in bone metastasis, inducing osteoclastogenesis. In NSCLC, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway is constitutively activated. EGFR binds Amphiregulin (AREG) that is overexpressed in several cancers such as colon, breast and lung. Its levels in plasma of NSCLC patients correlate with poor prognosis and AREG was recently found as a signaling molecule in exosomes derived from cancer cell lines. Exosomes have a key role in the cell-cell communication and they were recently indicated as important actors in metastatic niche preparation. In the present work, we hypothesize a role of AREG carried by exosomes derived from NSCLC in bone metastasis induction. We observed that NSCLC-exosomes, containing AREG, induce EGFR pathway activation in pre-osteoclasts that in turn causes an increased expression of RANKL. RANKL is able to induce the expression of proteolytic enzymes, well-known markers of osteoclastogenesis, triggering a vicious cycle in osteolytic bone metastasis.

--- Paper 5: Paeoniflorin ameliorates collagen‐induced arthritis via suppressing nuclear factor‐κB signalling pathway in osteoclast differentiation ---
Paeoniflorin (PF), extracted from the root of Paeonia lactiflora Pall, exhibits anti‐inflammatory properties in several autoimmune diseases. Osteoclast, the only somatic cell with bone resorbing capacity, was the direct cause of bone destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and its mouse model, collagen‐induced arthritis (CIA). The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of PF on CIA mice, and explore the mechanism of PF in bone destruction. We demonstrated that PF treatment significantly ameliorated CIA through inflammatory response inhibition and bone destruction suppression. Furthermore, PF treatment markedly decreased osteoclast number through the altered RANKL/RANK/OPG ratio and inflammatory cytokines profile. Consistently, we found that osteoclast differentiation was significantly inhibited by PF through down‐regulation of nuclear factor‐κB activation in vitro. Moreover, we found that PF suppressed nuclear factor‐κB activation by decreasing its translocation to the nucleus in osteoclast precursor cells. Taken together, our new findings provide insights into a novel function of PF in osteoclastogenesis and demonstrate that PF would be a new therapeutic modality as a natural agent for RA treatment and other autoimmune conditions with bone erosion.

The relationship between Th17 cell differentiation and osteoclast differentiation is highlighted through various findings in the abstracts provided. For instance, the study discusses how BCAP is crucial in regulating Th17 cells, subsequently affecting inflammatory responses, which could imply that Th17 lineage cells influence osteoclast activity (BCAP links IL-1R to the PI3K–mTOR pathway and regulates pathogenic Th17 cell differentiation). Additionally, while Bacteroides uniformis significantly ameliorates colitis and modulates Th17 differentiation, it suggests the need for further exploration of gut microbiota's impact on bone metabolism and osteoclastogenesis (Bacteroides uniformis-induced perturbations in colonic microbiota and bile acid levels inhibit TH17 differentiation and ameliorate colitis developments). Furthermore, the role of Amphiregulin in NSCLC exosomes promotes osteoclast differentiation via the EGFR pathway, linking cancer-derived factors to osteoclast activity and indicating a potential intersection with Th17-related inflammation (Amphiregulin contained in NSCLC-exosomes induces osteoclast differentiation through the activation of EGFR pathway). These observations suggest a complex interplay where Th17 cells and associated signaling pathways could modulate osteoclast differentiation, warranting further investigation into these interactions for potential therapeutic avenues.

--- Paper 1: DDIT4 and Associated lncDDIT4 Modulate Th17 Differentiation through the DDIT4/TSC/mTOR Pathway ---
Inflammation that complicates many autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), has been correlated to abnormal differentiation of Th17 cells. However, the reasons that promote Th17 cell–driven autoimmunity are yet to be discovered. In this study, we sought evidence that DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4) and its associated long noncoding RNA DDIT4 (lncDDIT4) inhibit Th17 cell differentiation. We recruited 36 patients. Six MS patients and five healthy volunteers (controls) contributed PBMCs as material for microarray analysis. Microarray assays of lncDDIT4 and DDIT4 RNA expression identified outstanding differences between MS and control subjects, which were verified with real-time quantitative PCR. We then interrupted the expression of lncDDIT4 and DDIT4 mRNA in MS patients’ naive CD4+ T cells and observed the resulting changes in Th17 cells. The expression of lncDDIT4 and DDIT4 mRNA were higher both in PBMCs and CD4+ T cells of MS patients than in healthy controls. DDIT4 (2.79-fold upregulation) was then recognized as a candidate for the cis-regulated target of lncDDIT4 (4.32-fold upregulation). Isolation of naive CD4+ T cells revealed enhanced levels of lncDDIT4 and DDIT4 after stimulated with Th17-inducing cytokines, but not after Th1, Th2, or T regulatory cell induction. Overexpression of lncDDIT4 in naive CD4+ T cells inhibited IL-17 transcription through increased DDIT4 expression and decreased activation of the DDIT4/mTOR pathway. Consistently, silencing lncDDIT4 in naive CD4+ T cells enhanced Th17 differentiation through increased activation of the DDIT4/mTOR pathway. However, these results vanished when DDIT4 was silenced. This outcome suggests that lncDDIT4 regulates Th17 cell differentiation by directly targeting DDIT4.

--- Paper 2: The correlation between the Th17/Treg cell balance and bone health ---
With the ageing of the world population, osteoporosis has become a problem affecting quality of life. According to the traditional view, the causes of osteoporosis mainly include endocrine disorders, metabolic disorders and mechanical factors. However, in recent years, the immune system and immune factors have been shown to play important roles in the occurrence and development of osteoporosis. Among these components, regulatory T (Treg) cells and T helper 17 (Th17) cells are crucial for maintaining bone homeostasis, especially osteoclast differentiation. Treg cells and Th17 cells originate from the same precursor cells, and their differentiation requires involvement of the TGF-β regulated signalling pathway. Treg cells and Th17 cells have opposite functions. Treg cells inhibit the differentiation of osteoclasts in vivo and in vitro, while Th17 cells promote the differentiation of osteoclasts. Therefore, understanding the balance between Treg cells and Th17 cells is anticipated to provide a new idea for the development of novel treatments for osteoporosis.

Background: This study aimed to investigate long-non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression profiles and the correlation of lnc-ITSN1-2 expression with disease risk, activity and inflammation, and its influence on CD4+ T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods: LncRNA expression profiles were detected in intestinal mucosa samples from six IBD patients and six healthy controls (HCs). Intestinal mucosa and PBMC lnc-ITSN1-2, IL-23R, and inflammatory cytokines were measured in 120 IBD patients [60 Crohn's disease (CD) and 60 ulcerative colitis (UC)] and 30 HCs. Effect of lnc-ITSN1-2 on IBD CD4+ T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation was determined and its regulatory interaction with miR-125a and IL-23R was detected. Results: Three-hundred-and-nine upregulated and 310 downregulated lncRNAs were identified in IBD patients by RNA-Sequencing, which were enriched in regulating immune and inflammation related pathways. Large-sample qPCR validation disclosed that both intestinal mucosa and PBMC lnc-ITSN1-2 expressions were increased in IBD patients compared to HCs, and presented with good predictive values for IBD risk, especially for active disease conditions, and they positively correlated with disease activity, inflammation cytokines, and IL-23R in IBD patients. Lnc-ITSN1-2 was decreased after infliximab treatment in active-CD patients. Furthermore, lnc-ITSN1-2 promoted IBD CD4+ T cell activation and proliferation, and stimulated Th1/Th17 cell differentiation. Multiple rescue experiments disclosed that lnc-ITSN1-2 functioned in IBD CD4+ T cells via targeting miR-125a, then positively regulating IL-23R. Luciferase Reporter assay observed that lnc-ITSN1-2 bound miR-125a, and miR-125a bound IL-23R. Conclusion: Lnc-ITSN1-2 correlates with increased disease risk, activity, and inflammatory cytokines of IBD, and promotes IBD CD4+ T cell activation, proliferation, and Th1/Th17 cell differentiation by serving as a competing endogenous RNA for IL-23R via sponging miR-125a.

--- Paper 4: T Cell Costimulation Molecules CD80/86 Inhibit Osteoclast Differentiation by Inducing the IDO/Tryptophan Pathway ---
Costimulatory molecules CD80/CD86 suppress osteoclast differentiation by inducing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. A Bone to Pick with the Immune System School children are often taught that bones are static, providing support for the body. However, bone is actually a very dynamic tissue, constantly being built up and broken down. When this process is out of balance, for example, with excessive resorption, bone disease such as osteoporosis or fracture occurs. Now, Bozec et al. describe a process by which the immune system helps to control bone resorption. The authors found that the immune costimulatory molecules CD80/86 negatively regulate generation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Mice deficient in these molecules were osteopenic because of increased osteoclast differentiation. Mechanistically, CD80/86 stimulation resulted in activation of an enzyme—indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)—in osteoclast precursors, which degraded tryptophan and promoted osteoclast apoptosis. The authors then looked in humans that had been treated with either ipilimumab (a blocking antibody to CTLA-4, which binds CD80/86) or abatacept (a CTLA-4–Ig fusion protein). Consistent with their mouse data, they found that ipilimumab increased whereas abatacept reduced the frequency of osteoclasts. These data suggest that immune costimulatory molecules can regulate bone resorption and highlight potential skeletal effects of immune costimulation–targeting therapies. Bone resorption is seminal for the physiological remodeling of bone during life. However, this process needs to be strictly controlled; excessive bone resorption results in pathologic bone loss, osteoporosis, and fracture. We describe a control mechanism of bone resorption by the adaptive immune system. CD80/86, a pair of molecules expressed by antigen-presenting cells and involved in T cell costimulation, act as negative regulator for the generation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. CD80/86-deficient mice were osteopenic because of increased osteoclast differentiation. CD80/86-deficient osteoclasts escaped physiological inhibition by CTLA-4 or regulatory T cells. Mechanistically, engagement of CD80/86 by CTLA-4 induced activation of the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in osteoclast precursors, which degraded tryptophan and promoted apoptosis. Concordantly, IDO-deficient mice also showed an osteopenic bone phenotype with higher numbers of osteoclast precursors and osteoclasts. Also, IDO-deficient mononuclear cells escaped the anti-osteoclastogenic effect of CTLA-4. This molecular mechanism was also present in humans because targeting CD80/86 by abatacept, a CTLA-4–immunoglobulin fusion protein, reduced, whereas blockade of CTLA-4 by ipilimumab antibody enhanced, the frequency of peripheral osteoclast precursors and osteoclastogenesis. In summary, these data show an important role of the adaptive immune system, in particular T cell CD80/86 costimulation molecules, in the physiological regulation of bone resorption and preservation of bone mass, as well as affect the understanding of the function of current and future drugs fostering or blocking the effects of CTLA-4 in humans.

--- Paper 5: Dendritic cell MST1 inhibits Th17 differentiation ---
Although the differentiation of CD4+T cells is widely studied, the mechanisms of antigen-presenting cell-dependent T-cell modulation are unclear. Here, we investigate the role of dendritic cell (DC)-dependent T-cell differentiation in autoimmune and antifungal inflammation and find that mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (MST1) signalling from DCs negatively regulates IL-17 producing-CD4+T helper cell (Th17) differentiation. MST1 deficiency in DCs increases IL-17 production by CD4+T cells, whereas ectopic MST1 expression in DCs inhibits it. Notably, MST1-mediated DC-dependent Th17 differentiation regulates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and antifungal immunity. Mechanistically, MST1-deficient DCs promote IL-6 secretion and regulate the activation of IL-6 receptor α/β and STAT3 in CD4+T cells in the course of inducing Th17 differentiation. Activation of the p38 MAPK signal is responsible for IL-6 production in MST1-deficient DCs. Thus, our results define the DC MST1–p38MAPK signalling pathway in directing Th17 differentiation. The differentiation of Th17 cells is central to infection and autoimmunity. Here, the authors show that expression of MST1 by dendritic cells limits IL-6 production and thereby controls Th17 differentiation in immunity to fungal infection and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

The differentiation of Th17 cells has been identified as a significant factor potentiating osteoclast differentiation, highlighting the intricate interplay between immune mechanisms and bone health. One study emphasizes that Th17 cells promote osteoclast differentiation, contrasting with Treg cells, which inhibit this process (Lei Zhu et al., 2020, Immunity & Ageing). Another paper presents evidence that factors influencing Th17 differentiation, such as the DDIT4/mTOR pathway, could indirectly affect osteoclast activity by altering the balance of immune cell types involved (Fang Zhang et al., 2018, Journal of Immunology). Furthermore, the elucidation of the regulatory roles of various cytokines on Th17 cells suggests multiple targets for therapy that could modulate osteoclastogenesis in bone-related disorders (Jia-yan Nie et al., 2020, Frontiers in Immunology). However, gaps remain in fully understanding the mechanisms through which Th17 cell differentiation specifically influences osteoclast populations and the resultant effects on bone health, emphasizing an area for further exploration in future studies (Chen et al., 2014, Science Translational Medicine). Establishing these links may foster novel therapeutic strategies in managing osteoporosis and other bone-associated conditions.

--- Paper 1: The Ratio of Messenger RNA Levels of Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor κB Ligand to Osteoprotegerin Correlates with Bone Remodeling Indices in Normal Human Cancellous Bone but Not in Osteoarthritis ---
The determinants of cancellous bone turnover and trabecular structure are not understood in normal bone or skeletal disease. Bone remodeling is initiated by osteoclastic resorption followed by osteoblastic formation of new bone. Receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) is a newly described regulator of osteoclast formation and function, the activity of which appears to be a balance between interaction with its receptor RANK and with an antagonist binding protein osteoprotegerin (OPG). Therefore, we have examined the relationship between the expression of RANKL, RANK, and OPG and indices of bone structure and turnover in human cancellous bone from the proximal femur. Bone samples were obtained from individuals with osteoarthritis (OA) at joint replacement surgery and from autopsy controls. Histomorphometric analysis of these samples showed that eroded surface (ES/BS) and osteoid surface (OS/BS) were positively associated in both control (p < 0.001) and OA (p < 0.02), indicating that the processes of bone resorption and bone formation remain coupled in OA, as they are in controls. RANKL, OPG, and RANK messenger RNA (mRNA) were abundant in human cancellous bone, with significant differences between control and OA individuals. In coplotting the molecular and histomorphometric data, strong associations were found between the ratio of RANKL/OPG mRNA and the indices of bone turnover (RANKL/OPG vs. ES/BS: r = 0.93, p < 0.001; RANKL/OPG vs. OS/BS: r = 0.80, p < 0.001). These relationships were not evident in trabecular bone from severe OA, suggesting that bone turnover may be regulated differently in this disease. We propose that the effective concentration of RANKL is related causally to bone turnover.

--- Paper 2: HMGB1 expression and release by bone cells ---
Immune and bone cells are functionally coupled by pro‐inflammatory cytokine intercellular signaling networks common to both tissues and their crosstalk may contribute to the etiologies of some immune‐associated bone pathologies. For example, the receptor activator of NF‐κB ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin (OPG)/receptor activator of NF‐κB (RANK) signaling axis plays a critical role in dendritic cell (DC) function as well as bone remodeling. The expression of RANKL by immune cells may contribute to bone loss in periodontitis, arthritis, and multiple myeloma. A recent discovery reveals that DCs release the chromatin protein high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) as a potent immunomodulatory cytokine mediating the interaction between DCs and T‐cells, via HMGB1 binding to the membrane receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). To determine whether osteoblasts or osteoclasts express and/or release HMGB1 into the bone microenvironment, we analyzed tissue, cells, and culture media for the presence of this molecule. Our immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical analyses demonstrate HMGB1 expression in primary osteoblasts and osteoclasts and that both cells express RAGE. HMGB1 is recoverable in the media of primary osteoblast cultures and cultures of isolated osteoclast precursors and osteoclasts. Parathyroid hormone (PTH), a regulator of bone remodeling, attenuates HMGB1 release in cultures of primary osteoblasts and MC3T3‐E1 osteoblast‐like cells but augments this release in the rat osteosarcoma cell line UMR 106‐01, both responses primarily via activation of adenylyl cyclase. PTH‐induced HMGB1 discharge by UMR cells exhibits similar release kinetics as reported for activated macrophages. These data confirm the presence of the HMGB1/RAGE signaling axis in bone. J. Cell.

--- Paper 3: Pathogenesis of bone disease in multiple myeloma: from bench to bedside ---
Osteolytic bone disease is the hallmark of multiple myeloma, which deteriorates the quality of life of myeloma patients, and it affects dramatically their morbidity and mortality. The basis of the pathogenesis of myeloma-related bone disease is the uncoupling of the bone-remodeling process. The interaction between myeloma cells and the bone microenvironment ultimately leads to the activation of osteoclasts and suppression of osteoblasts, resulting in bone loss. Several intracellular and intercellular signaling cascades, including RANK/RANKL/OPG, Notch, Wnt, and numerous chemokines and interleukins are implicated in this complex process. During the last years, osteocytes have emerged as key regulators of bone loss in myeloma through direct interactions with the myeloma cells. The myeloma-induced crosstalk among the molecular pathways establishes a positive feedback that sustains myeloma cell survival and continuous bone destruction, even when a plateau phase of the disease has been achieved. Targeted therapies, based on the better knowledge of the biology, constitute a promising approach in the management of myeloma-related bone disease and several novel agents are currently under investigation. Herein, we provide an insight into the underlying pathogenesis of bone disease and discuss possible directions for future studies.

--- Paper 4: A comprehensive manually curated reaction map of RANKL/RANK-signaling pathway ---
Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) is a member of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily that plays a key role in the regulation of differentiation, activation and survival of osteoclasts and also in tumor cell migration and bone metastasis. Osteoclast activation induced by RANKL regulates hematopoietic stem cell mobilization as part of homeostasis and host defense mechanisms thereby linking regulation of hematopoiesis with bone remodeling. Binding of RANKL to its receptor, Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (RANK) activates molecules such as NF-kappa B, mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and phosphatidyl 3-kinase (PI3K). Although the molecular and cellular roles of these molecules have been reported previously, a systematic cataloging of the molecular events induced by RANKL/RANK interaction has not been attempted. Here, we present a comprehensive reaction map of the RANKL/RANK-signaling pathway based on an extensive manual curation of the published literature. We hope that the curated RANKL/RANK-signaling pathway model would enable new biomedical discoveries, which can provide novel insights into disease processes and development of novel therapeutic interventions.

--- Paper 5: Crystal Structure of Human RANKL Complexed with Its Decoy Receptor Osteoprotegerin ---
Receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), its signaling receptor RANK, and its decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG) constitute a molecular triad that is critical in regulating bone remodeling, and also plays multiple roles in the immune system. OPG binds RANKL directly to block its interaction with RANK. In this article, we report the 2.7-Å crystal structure of human RANKL trimer in complex with the N-terminal fragment of human OPG containing four cysteine-rich TNFR homologous domains (OPG-CRD). The structure shows that RANKL trimer uses three equivalent grooves between two neighboring monomers to interact with three OPG-CRD monomers symmetrically. A loop from the CRD3 domain of OPG-CRD inserts into the shallow groove of RANKL, providing the major binding determinant that is further confirmed by affinity measurement and osteoclast differentiation assay. These results, together with a previously reported mouse RANKL/RANK complex structure, reveal that OPG exerts its decoy receptor function by directly blocking the accessibilities of important interacting residues of RANKL for RANK recognition. Structural comparison with TRAIL/death receptor 5 complex also reveals structural basis for the cross-reactivity of OPG to TRAIL.

The RANK/RANKL signaling pathway is crucial in mediating bone remodeling, primarily by facilitating the differentiation and activation of osteoclasts. The ratio of RANKL to its decoy receptor OPG correlates significantly with indices of bone turnover, suggesting that RANKL levels directly influence bone remodeling processes in normal and osteoarthritis-affected human cancellous bone (The Ratio of Messenger RNA Levels of Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor κB Ligand to Osteoprotegerin Correlates with Bone Remodeling Indices in Normal Human Cancellous Bone but Not in Osteoarthritis, N. Fazzalari et al., Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, 2001). Additionally, the sustained interaction between myeloma cells and the RANK/RANKL/OPG axis results in bone loss through osteoclast activation and osteoblast suppression, highlighting the pathway's role in pathological conditions (Pathogenesis of bone disease in multiple myeloma: from bench to bedside, E. Terpos et al., Blood Cancer Journal, 2018). The structure-function relationship within the RANKL, RANK, and OPG triad further elucidates how RANKL can effectively mediate osteoclastogenesis, laying the groundwork for potential therapeutic interventions (Crystal Structure of Human RANKL Complexed with Its Decoy Receptor Osteoprotegerin, X. Luan et al., Journal of Immunology, 2012). However, gaps remain in understanding how these molecular interactions vary across different diseases impacting bone health, suggesting that further exploration could yield novel insights into targeted therapies.

--- Paper 1: Prognostic role of nuclear factor/IB and bone remodeling proteins in metastatic giant cell tumor of bone: A retrospective study ---
Giant cell tumor of bone (GCTb) represents 5% of bone tumors, and although considered benign, 5% metastasize to the lung. The expression of proteins directly or indirectly associated with osteolysis and tumor growth was studied on 163 samples of GCTb. Of these, 33 patients developed lung metastasis during follow‐up. The impact of tumor–host interaction on clinical aspects was evaluated with the aim of finding specific markers for new biological therapies, thus improving clinical management of GCTb. Protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis on Tissue Microarray. The majority of GCTb samples from patients with metastatic disease were strongly positive to RANKL and its receptor RANK as well as to CAII and MMP‐2 and to pro‐survival proteins NFIB and c‐Fos. Kaplan–Meier analysis indicated a significant difference in metastasis free survival curves based on protein staining. Interestingly, the statistical correlation established a strong association between all variables studied with a higher τ coefficient for RANK/RANKL, RANK/NFIB, and RANKL/NFIB pairs. At multivariate analysis co‐overexpression of NFIB, RANK and RANKL significantly increased the risk of metastasis with an odds ratio of 13.59 (95%CI 4.12–44.82; p < 0.0005). In conclusion, the interconnection between matrix remodeling and tumor cell activity may identify tumor–host endpoints for new biological treatments. © 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

--- Paper 2: RANKL expression, function, and therapeutic targeting in multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. ---
Bone destruction is a prominent feature of multiple myeloma, but conflicting data exist on the expression and pathophysiologic involvement of the bone remodeling ligand RANKL in this disease and the potential therapeutic benefits of its targeted inhibition. Here, we show that RANKL is expressed by primary multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, whereas release of soluble RANKL was observed exclusively with multiple myeloma cells and was strongly influenced by posttranscriptional/posttranslational regulation. Signaling via RANKL into multiple myeloma and CLL cells induced release of cytokines involved in disease pathophysiology. Both the effects of RANKL on osteoclastogenesis and cytokine production by malignant cells could be blocked by disruption of RANK-RANKL interaction with denosumab. As we aimed to combine neutralization of RANKL with induction of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells against RANKL-expressing malignant cells and as denosumab does not stimulate NK reactivity, we generated RANK-Fc fusion proteins with modified Fc moieties. The latter displayed similar capacity compared with denosumab to neutralize the effects of RANKL on osteoclastogenesis in vitro, but also potently stimulated NK cell reactivity against primary RANKL-expressing malignant B cells, which was dependent on their engineered affinity to CD16. Our findings introduce Fc-optimized RANK-Ig fusion proteins as attractive tools to neutralize the detrimental function of RANKL while at the same time potently stimulating NK cell antitumor immunity.

--- Paper 3: Soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand-osteoprotegerin ratio predicts survival in multiple myeloma: proposal for a novel prognostic index. ---
Interaction between receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL) and RANK/osteoprotegerin (OPG) plays a dominant role in osteoclast activation and possibly in plasma cell survival in multiple myeloma (MM). We measured soluble RANKL (sRANKL), OPG, and bone remodeling markers in 121 patients with newly diagnosed MM to evaluate their role in bone disease and survival. Serum levels of sRANKL were elevated in patients with MM and correlated with bone disease. The sRANKL/OPG ratio was also increased and correlated with markers of bone resorption, osteolytic lesions, and markers of disease activity. The sRANKL/OPG ratio, C-reactive protein (CRP), and beta2-microglobulin were the only independent prognostic factors predicting survival in multivariate analysis. We generated a prognostic index based on these factors that divided our patients into 3 risk groups. The low-risk group had a 96% probability of survival at 5 years, whereas the intermediate-risk and the high-risk groups had probabilities of survival of 52% and 0%, respectively. Not only do these results confirm for the first time in humans the importance of sRANKL/OPG in the development of bone disease, they also highlight the role of this pathway in the biology of plasma cell growth as reflected by its influence on survival.

--- Paper 4: Systemic osteoprotegerin gene therapy restores tumor-induced bone loss in a therapeutic model of breast cancer bone metastasis. ---
Enhanced production of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) and its binding to RANK on the osteoclasts have been associated with osteolysis in breast cancer bone metastasis. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a decoy receptor that prevents RANKL-RANK interaction. This study determined the effects of sustained expression of OPG using a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector in mouse model of osteolytic breast cancer. Bone metastasis was established by intracardiac injection of the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-435. Following this, mice were administered a one-time intramuscular injection of rAAV encoding either OPG.Fc (OPG) or green fluorescent protein (GFP). Mice were killed 1 month later and the effects of therapy on tumor growth and bone remodeling were evaluated. Bioluminescence imaging showed significant reduction of tumor growth in bone of OPG.Fc-treated mice. Micro-computed tomography (microCT) analysis and histomorphometry of the tibia indicated significant protection of trabecular and cortical bones after OPG.Fc therapy. Despite the prevention of bone loss and tumor growth in bone, OPG.Fc therapy failed to provide long-term survival. OPG.Fc-treated mice developed more bone than age-matched normal mice, indicating a requirement for regulated transgene expression. Results of this study indicate the potential of rAAV-OPG therapy for reducing morbidity and mortality in breast cancer patients with osteolytic bone damage.

--- Paper 5: Role of OSCAR Signaling in Osteoclastogenesis and Bone Disease ---
Formation of mature bone-resorbing cells through osteoclastogenesis is required for the continuous remodeling and repair of bone tissue. In aging and disease this process may become aberrant, resulting in excessive bone degradation and fragility fractures. Interaction of receptor-activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK) with its ligand RANKL activates the main signaling pathway for osteoclastogenesis. However, compelling evidence indicates that this pathway may not be sufficient for the production of mature osteoclast cells and that co-stimulatory signals may be required for both the expression of osteoclast-specific genes and the activation of osteoclasts. Osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR), a regulator of osteoclast differentiation, provides one such co-stimulatory pathway. This review summarizes our present knowledge of osteoclastogenesis signaling and the role of OSCAR in the normal production of bone-resorbing cells and in bone disease. Understanding the signaling mechanism through this receptor and how it contributes to the production of mature osteoclasts may offer a more specific and targeted approach for pharmacological intervention against pathological bone resorption.

The RANK/RANKL pathway plays a crucial role in bone remodeling, influencing processes such as osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. In metastatic giant cell tumors of the bone, there is a significant positive correlation between the expression of RANK/RANKL and tumor behavior, indicating that these proteins could serve as potential markers for metastatic risk and therapeutic targets (Prognostic role of nuclear factor/IB and bone remodeling proteins in metastatic giant cell tumor of bone: A retrospective study). Additionally, in multiple myeloma, elevated levels of soluble RANKL have been associated with osteolytic bone disease, suggesting that the RANKL/OPG axis is pivotal in this context (Role of soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand-osteoprotegerin ratio predicts survival in multiple myeloma: proposal for a novel prognostic index). Furthermore, the study on breast cancer bone metastasis reveals that RANKL is implicated in osteolysis, supporting the idea that manipulating the RANKL-RANK interaction could mitigate tumor-induced bone loss (Systemic osteoprotegerin gene therapy restores tumor-induced bone loss in a therapeutic model of breast cancer bone metastasis). This highlights both the therapeutic potential and need for further investigation into the complex interactions influencing bone remodeling via the RANK/RANKL pathway (RANKL expression, function, and therapeutic targeting in multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia). However, gaps remain regarding the modulation of this pathway in various conditions and the necessity for additional co-stimulatory signals in osteoclast differentiation (Role of OSCAR Signaling in Osteoclastogenesis and Bone Disease). Exploring these avenues could generate novel hypotheses for therapeutic interventions targeted around the RANK/RANKL pathway.

--- Paper 2: Structural and Functional Insights of RANKL–RANK Interaction and Signaling ---
Bone remodeling involves bone resorption by osteoclasts and synthesis by osteoblasts and is tightly regulated by the receptor activator of the NF-κB ligand (RANKL)/receptor activator of the NF-κB (RANK)/osteoprotegerin molecular triad. RANKL, a member of the TNF superfamily, induces osteoclast differentiation, activation and survival upon interaction with its receptor RANK. The decoy receptor osteoprotegerin inhibits osteoclast formation by binding to RANKL. Imbalance in this molecular triad can result in diseases, including osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, we report the crystal structures of unliganded RANK and its complex with RANKL and elucidation of critical residues for the function of the receptor pair. RANK represents the longest TNFR with four full cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) in which the CRD4 is stabilized by a sodium ion and a rigid linkage with CRD3. On association, RANK moves via a hinge region between the CRD2 and CRD3 to make close contact with RANKL; a significant structural change previously unseen in the engagement of TNFR superfamily 1A with its ligand. The high-affinity interaction between RANK and RANKL, maintained by continuous contact between the pair rather than the patched interaction commonly observed, is necessary for the function because a slightly reduced affinity induced by mutation produces significant disruption of osteoclast formation. The structures of RANK and RANKL–RANK complex and the biological data presented in the paper are essential for not only our understanding of the specific nature of the signaling mechanism and of disease-related mutations found in patients but also structure based drug design.

--- Paper 3: RANKL/RANK/MMP-1 Molecular Triad Contributes to the Metastatic Phenotype of Breast and Prostate Cancer Cells In Vitro ---
The osteolytic nature of bone metastasis results from a tumor-driven increased bone resorption. Bone remodeling is orchestrated by the molecular triad RANK-RANKL-OPG. This process is dysregulated in bone metastases, mostly via induction of RANKL by tumor-derived factors. These factors increase expression of RANKL, which induce osteoclast formation, function, and survival, thereby increasing bone resorption. RANK is unexpectedly expressed by cancer cells, and the activation of RANKL-RANK pathway correlates with an increased invasive phenotype. To investigate the interaction between RANK expression in human breast and prostate cancer cells and their pro-metastatic phenotype we analyzed the activation of RANKL-RANK pathway and its effects on cell migration, invasion, gene expression in vitro, and osteolysis-inducing ability in vivo. RANKL activates kinase signaling pathways, stimulates cell migration, increases cell invasion, and up-regulates MMP-1 expression. In vivo, MMP-1 knockdown resulted in smaller x-ray osteolytic lesions and osteoclastogenesis, and decreased tumor burden. Therefore, RANKL inhibition in bone metastatic disease may decrease the levels of the osteoclastogenesis inducer MMP-1, contributing to a better clinical outcome.

--- Paper 4: Muscle RANK is a key regulator of Ca2+ storage, SERCA activity, and function of fast-twitch skeletal muscles. ---
Receptor-activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK), its ligand RANKL, and the soluble decoy receptor osteoprotegerin are the key regulators of osteoclast differentiation and bone remodeling. Here we show that RANK is also expressed in fully differentiated myotubes and skeletal muscle. Muscle RANK deletion has inotropic effects in denervated, but not in sham, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles preventing the loss of maximum specific force while promoting muscle atrophy, fatigability, and increased proportion of fast-twitch fibers. In denervated EDL muscles, RANK deletion markedly increased stromal interaction molecule 1 content, a Ca(2+)sensor, and altered activity of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) modulating Ca(2+)storage. Muscle RANK deletion had no significant effects on the sham or denervated slow-twitch soleus muscles. These data identify a novel role for RANK as a key regulator of Ca(2+)storage and SERCA activity, ultimately affecting denervated skeletal muscle function.

--- Paper 5: The Effect of Inflammation on Bone ---
Bone remodeling is the continual process to renew the adult skeleton through the sequential action of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Nuclear factor RANK, an osteoclast receptor, and its ligand RANKL, expressed on the surface of osteoblasts, result in coordinated control of bone remodeling. Inflammation, a feature of illness and injury, plays a distinct role in skewing this process toward resorption. It does so via the interaction of inflammatory mediators and their related peptides with osteoblasts and osteoclasts, as well as other immune cells, to alter the expression of RANK and RANKL. Such chemical mediators include TNFα, glucocorticoids, histamine, bradykinin, PGE2, systemic RANKL from immune cells, and interleukins 1 and 6. Conditions, such as periodontal disease and alveolar bone erosion, aseptic prosthetic loosening, rheumatoid arthritis, and some sports related injuries are characterized by the result of this process. A thorough understanding of bone response to injury and disease, and ability to detect such biomarkers, as well as imaging to identify early structural and mechanical property changes in bone architecture, is important in improving management and outcomes of bone related pathology. While gut health and vitamin and mineral availability appear vitally important, nutraceuticals also have an impact on bone health. To date most pharmaceutical intervention targets inflammatory cytokines, although strategies to favorably alter inflammation induced bone pathology are currently limited. Further research is required in this field to advance early detection and treatments.

Bone tissue undergoes remodeling that is intricately regulated by the RANK/RANKL signaling pathway. This pathway governs osteoclast differentiation and activity, thereby influencing bone resorption (Structural and Functional Insights of RANKL–RANK Interaction and Signaling). RANKL facilitates osteoclastogenesis by binding to its receptor, RANK, and any dysregulation in this interaction can lead to pathologies such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis (Structural and Functional Insights of RANKL–RANK Interaction and Signaling). Furthermore, inflammatory conditions can skew bone remodeling towards increased bone resorption by altering the expression of RANK and RANKL, as evidenced in various bone-related diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal disease (The Effect of Inflammation on Bone). Research has also highlighted that tumors can exploit the RANK/RANKL axis, promoting osteoclast activation and thus amplifying bone resorption in metastatic diseases (RANKL/RANK/MMP-1 Molecular Triad Contributes to the Metastatic Phenotype of Breast and Prostate Cancer Cells In Vitro). Despite existing knowledge, there remains a significant need to understand the precise mechanisms through which inflammation and tumorigenesis modify the RANK/RANKL pathway in bone remodeling (The Effect of Inflammation on Bone; RANKL/RANK/MMP-1 Molecular Triad Contributes to the Metastatic Phenotype of Breast and Prostate Cancer Cells In Vitro). This gap represents an opportunity to explore therapeutic interventions targeting the RANK/RANKL axis in both inflammatory and metastatic contexts (The Effect of Inflammation on Bone).

--- Paper 1: Synthesis and localization of fibronectin during collagenous matrix-mesenchymal cell interaction and differentiation of cartilage and bone in vivo. ---
The biosynthesis of fibronectin during the in vivo development of matrix-induced endochondral bone was investigated by using [35S]methionine in rats. The dmineralized bone matrix that was implanted subcutaneously to induce local bone formation bound circulating fibronectin. This may be an important initial requirement for cell attachment to the matrix. Fibronectin was present throughout the development of bone but accounted for the largest percentage of total protein synthesized during mesenchymal cell proliferation and hematopoiesis. Fibronectin was identified in tissue extracts by its (i) comigration on electrophoretic NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels with human and rat plasma fibronectin, (ii) affinity for denatured collagen, (iii) crossreactivity with purified antibody of rat plasma fibronectin, and (iv) insensitivity to collagenase digestion. Fibronectin was localized by immunofluorescence in the extracellular matrix during the period of mesenchymal cell proliferation. During chondrogenesis, fibronectin was demonstrated in the differentiating chondrocytes. Fibronectin was detectable in the cartilage matrix only after hyaluronidase treatment. During vascular invasion, prior to osteogenesis, fibronectin was localized in association with endothelial cells. These observations demonstrate a possible role of fibronectin in collagenous matrix-mesenchymal cell interaction in vivo.

--- Paper 2: Interleukin‐5 binds to heparin/heparan sulfate. A model for an interaction with extracellular matrix ---
Interleukin‐5 (IL‐5) is the major cytokine regulating eosinophil production. In allergic disease tissue damage is primarily caused by eosinophils. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are components of the bone marrow stroma, which supports hemopoietic cell differentiation and proliferation. We show that at low IL‐5 concentrations heparan sulfate enhances the proliferation of an IL‐5‐dependent cell line. To investigate a mechanism for this effect we used an artificial proteoglycan to establish an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay for the binding of heparin to proteins. Using this assay we demonstrate that IL‐5 binds to heparin. The IL‐5/heparin interaction is inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetate and enhanced by low concentrations of zinc ions. IL‐5 interacts with iduronic acid containing glycosaminoglycans, and heparan sulfate preparations that have numerous N‐sulfated domains per chain are especially efficient at inhibiting heparin binding. Both IL‐5/ heparin binding and the synergistic effect of IL‐5 and heparan sulfate on cell proliferation were inhibited by an anti‐IL‐5 monoclonal antibody. These data suggest that the binding of IL‐5 to heparan sulfate modulates IL‐5 activity. J. Leukoc. Biol. 63: 342–350; 1998.

--- Paper 3: Journey into Bone Models: A Review ---
Bone is a complex tissue with a variety of functions, such as providing mechanical stability for locomotion, protection of the inner organs, mineral homeostasis and haematopoiesis. To fulfil these diverse roles in the human body, bone consists of a multitude of different cells and an extracellular matrix that is mechanically stable, yet flexible at the same time. Unlike most tissues, bone is under constant renewal facilitated by a coordinated interaction of bone-forming and bone-resorbing cells. It is thus challenging to recreate bone in its complexity in vitro and most current models rather focus on certain aspects of bone biology that are of relevance for the research question addressed. In addition, animal models are still regarded as the gold-standard in the context of bone biology and pathology, especially for the development of novel treatment strategies. However, species-specific differences impede the translation of findings from animal models to humans. The current review summarizes and discusses the latest developments in bone tissue engineering and organoid culture including suitable cell sources, extracellular matrices and microfluidic bioreactor systems. With available technology in mind, a best possible bone model will be hypothesized. Furthermore, the future need and application of such a complex model will be discussed.

--- Paper 4: Toward biomimetic materials in bone regeneration: functional behavior of mesenchymal stem cells on a broad spectrum of extracellular matrix components. ---
Bone defect treatments can be augmented by mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) based therapies. MSC interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the surrounding tissue regulates their functional behavior. Understanding of these specific regulatory mechanisms is essential for the therapeutic stimulation of MSC in vivo. However, these interactions are presently only partially understood. This study examined in parallel, for the first time, the effects on the functional behavior of MSCs of 13 ECM components from bone, cartilage and hematoma compared to a control protein, and hence draws conclusions for rational biomaterial design. ECM components specifically modulated MSC adhesion, migration, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation, for example, fibronectin facilitated migration, adhesion, and proliferation, but not osteogenic differentiation, whereas fibrinogen enhanced adhesion and proliferation, but not migration. Subsequently, the integrin expression pattern of MSCs was determined and related to the cell behavior on specific ECM components. Finally, on this basis, peptide sequences are reported for the potential stimulation of MSC functions. Based on the results of this study, ECM component coatings could be designed to specifically guide cell functions.

--- Paper 5: Global transcriptome analysis of human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) reveals proliferative, mobile and interactive cells that produce abundant extracellular matrix proteins, some of which may affect BMSC potency. ---
BACKGROUND AIMS
Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) are being used for immune modulatory, anti-inflammatory and tissue engineering applications, but the properties responsible for these effects are not completely understood. Human BMSC were characterized to identify factors that might be responsible for their clinical effects and biomarkers for assessing their quality.


METHODS
Early passage BMSC prepared from marrow aspirates of seven healthy subjects were compared with three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) samples, CD34(+) cells from three healthy subjects and three fibroblast cell lines. The cells were analyzed with oligonucleotide expression microarrays with more than 35 000 probes.


RESULTS
BMSC gene expression signatures of BMSC differed from those of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), hESC and fibroblasts. Genes upregulated in BMSC were involved with cell movement, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction and proliferation. The upregulated genes most probably belonged to pathways for integrin signaling, integrin-linked kinase (ILK) signaling, NF-E2-related factor-2 (NFR2)-mediated oxidative stress response, regulation of actin-based motility by Rho, actin cytoskeletal signaling, caveolar-mediated endocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis and Wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt/β catenin signaling. Among the most highly upregulated genes were structural extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (α5 and β5 integrin chains, fibronectin and collagen type IIIα1 and Vα1) and functional EMC proteins [connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), transforming growth factor beta-induced protein (TGFBI) and A disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM12)].


CONCLUSIONS
Global analysis of human BMSC suggests that they are mobile, metabolically active, proliferative and interactive cells that make use of integrins and integrin signaling. They produce abundant ECM proteins that may contribute to their clinical immune modulatory and anti-inflammatory effects.

The structural support of bone tissue by extracellular matrix (ECM) components is emphasized by several studies. Fibronectin, a significant ECM protein, plays a crucial role in the interaction between mesenchymal cells and the collagen matrix during bone formation, suggesting its importance in stabilizing the bone structure (Synthesis and localization of fibronectin during collagenous matrix-mesenchymal cell interaction and differentiation of cartilage and bone in vivo, R. Weiss & A. Reddi, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 1980). Additionally, a broad range of ECM components regulates the behavior of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), affecting functions like adhesion and proliferation, highlighting the intricate role of the ECM in bone tissue dynamics (Toward biomimetic materials in bone regeneration: functional behavior of mesenchymal stem cells on a broad spectrum of extracellular matrix components, A. Ode et al., Journal of Biomedical Materials Research. Part A, 2010). Furthermore, bone marrow stromal cells are shown to produce extensive ECM proteins, which may enhance their functionality and contextual interactions with the bone ECM, further linking the structural components with cellular behavior (Global transcriptome analysis of human bone marrow stromal cells reveals proliferative, mobile and interactive cells that produce abundant extracellular matrix proteins, Jiaqiang Ren et al., Cytotherapy, 2011). This synthesis of findings indicates that while significant knowledge exists about specific roles of individual ECM components, further investigation is needed to determine their collective impact on bone regeneration and development.

--- Paper 1: The Influence of X-ray Radiation on the Mineral/Organic Matrix Interaction of Bone Tissue: An FT-IR Microscopic Investigation ---
Fourier transform infrared microscopy was used to investigate human cortical bone samples before and after treatment with increasing doses of X-ray radiation. Especially the spectral region of the v1 and v3 phosphate vibrations of hydroxyapatite, the main mineral component of bone, and the region of the amide I and amide II vibrational bands due to the collagen extracellular matrix were examined. Major spectral changes in the phosphate region between 1250–1000 cm–1 occur after irradiation doses between 1 and 4 Gray. These findings are explained by a decrease in size of mineral crystallites and by variances of the stoichiometric/non-stoichiometric apatite composition. The Ca2+/PO4 3-/HPO4 2- composition in the biological apatite is altered near the bone surface. The secondary structure of the collagen matrix is not affected by cumulative irradiation up to doses of 15 Gray as indicated by the unchanged frequency maximum and contour shape of the amide I band between 1600–1700 cm–1. However, side chain carboxylate groups of the collagen matrix that are involved in coordination with apatite bound calcium ions are partially removed by decarboxylation upon irradiation. Concomitantly, a loss of acidic phosphate groups due to a formation of phosphate groups with bound calcium is observed. These changes on a molecular level can be correlated with alterations in the mechanical properties of the bone samples, e.g. with an increased embrittlement as deduced from experiments with a scanning acoustic microscope (1).

--- Paper 2: Mechanically Strained Cells of the Osteoblast Lineage Organize Their Extracellular Matrix Through Unique Sites of αVβ3‐Integrin Expression ---
Bone cells transduce mechanical signals into anabolic biochemical responses. However, the mechanisms of mechanotransduction are unknown. To address this issue, we performed studies in primary cells of the human osteoblast lineage grown on collagen/vitronectin‐coated supports. We discovered that mechanical strain stimulated a redistribution of the αvβ3‐integrin to irregular plaque‐like areas at the cell‐extracellular matrix surface. Proteins involved in integrin‐matrix interactions in focal adhesions, vinculin and talin, did not localize to the plaque‐like areas of αvβ3‐expression, but signaling molecules such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) did. Mechanical strain increased the number and size of the plaques defined by surface expression of αvβ3‐integrin. Osteopontin was secreted as a cross‐linked macromolecular complex, likely through the action of tissue transglutaminase that also was found in the plaques of αvβ3‐integrin cell‐matrix interaction. Mechanical strain increased mineralization of the extracellular matrix that developed in these plaques in αvβ3‐integrin‐dependent manner. Because the plaque‐like areas of cell‐matrix interaction exhibit macromolecular assembly and mineralization, we conclude that they may represent subcellular domains of bone formation and that αvβ3‐integrin activation represents one mechanism by which mechanical strain stimulates bone formation.

--- Paper 3: Bone Tissue Engineering Scaffolds: Function of Multi‐Material Hierarchically Structured Scaffolds ---
Bone tissue engineering (BTE) is a topic of interest for the last decade, and advances in materials, processing techniques, and the understanding of bone healing pathways have opened new avenues of research. The dual responsibility of BTE scaffolds in providing load‐bearing capability and interaction with the local extracellular matrix to promote bone healing is a challenge in synthetic scaffolds. This article describes the usage and processing of multi‐materials and hierarchical structures to mimic the structure of natural bone tissues to function as bioactive and load‐bearing synthetic scaffolds. The first part of this literature review describes the physiology of bone healing responses and the interactions at different stages of bone repair. The following section reviews the available literature on biomaterials used for BTE scaffolds followed by some multi‐material approaches. The next section discusses the impact of the scaffold's structural features on bone healing and the necessity of a hierarchical distribution in the scaffold structure. Finally, the last section of this review highlights the emerging trends in BTE scaffold developments that can inspire new tissue engineering strategies and truly develop the next generation of synthetic scaffolds.

--- Paper 4: Decellularized Tracheal Matrix Scaffold for Tissue Engineering ---
Background: A tracheal matrix scaffold decellularized by detergent-enzymatic treatment has been shown as a promising scaffold in tracheal tissue engineering. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of this technique on tracheal extracellular matrix integrity and characterize the matrix environment for recellularization. Methods: Brown Norway rat tracheae were decellularized using a modified detergent-enzymatic treatment. Antigenicity and cellularity were monitored during processing. Glycosaminoglycan content, histoarchitecture, and mechanical properties were also evaluated. Matrix compatibility was determined by cytotoxicity assay. Surface ultrastructure of the matrix and its interaction with seeded bone marrow stem cell–derived chondrocytes and tracheal epithelial cells were examined by scanning electron microscopy. Results: Rat trachea treated with five detergent-enzymatic treatment cycles demonstrated complete elimination of antigenicity. Although there was a significant loss of glycosaminoglycan (t test, p < 0.01), histoarchitecture of tracheal cartilage and basement membrane was retained after decellularization. Stiffness decreased, but sufficient compressive strength was preserved to maintain lumen patency. The decellularized matrix showed good cell compatibility and favored adhesion and growth of chondrocytes and respiratory epithelial cells, as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. Conclusions: At the point of complete antigen removal, detergent-enzymatic treatment altered tracheal extracellular matrix composition but preserved the major structure and adequate mechanical strength. The matrix provided a compatible and supportive environment for recellularization.

--- Paper 5: Regulatory effects of stem cell factor and interleukin-4 on adhesion of human mast cells to extracellular matrix proteins. ---
Mast cells are inflammatory and immunoregulatory cells resident in tissues. They develop from bone marrow-derived progenitor cells that enter the tissue through the blood circulation. The specific localization and migration of mast cells in tissues is dependent on their interaction with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Adhesion of human mast cells isolated from intestinal mucosa and cultured in the presence of stem cell factor (SCF) to ECM proteins is analyzed. It was observed that SCF is a unique cytokine enhancing mast cell adhesion to all tested ECM proteins (fibronectin, laminin, collagen I, III, IV, VI, XIV) up to 5-fold, particularly to fibronectin (54% +/- 12% of mast cells) and to denatured collagens (40% +/- 12% on cyanogen bromide-cleaved peptides of collagen I). Most noteworthy, preculture of mast cells with interleukin-4 (IL-4), in addition to SCF, reduced their potency to adhere to ECM proteins to one third compared to mast cells cultured with SCF alone. Mast cell adhesion was preferentially mediated by beta1 integrins, and most cells expressed the ECM-binding integrins alpha2beta1, alpha3beta1, alpha4beta1, alpha5beta1, and alphaVbeta3. SCF-induced mast cell adhesion was totally blocked by wortmannin and apigenin, indicating an involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase, and it was related to an up-regulation of the HUTS-21 beta1 epitope, which is associated with an activated conformation of beta1. In conclusion, these data indicate that SCF induces the adhesion of cultured mast cells to ECM proteins, whereas IL-4 may promote detachment from the ECM.

  "justification": "The study investigates the role of transposable element (TE) activation in cellular senescence, linking epigenetic changes such as hypomethylation to TE transcription and subsequent pro-inflammatory pathways. This directly contributes to our understanding of aging mechanisms and inflammation, which are central to longevity research.",
